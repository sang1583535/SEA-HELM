Bad weather has delayed a consignment of rocks being shipped from Cornwall. Four-hundred and fifty tonnes of rock has already been used to fill the hole and strengthen the sea side of the wall. Lyall Cairns, of the Eastern Solent Coastal Defence Partnership, said completing the emergency work during the Christmas holiday period had been \"incredibly challenging\". The 1,800 tonnes of rock is due to be transported to Shoreham later in the week, from where it will be taken to Portsmouth by road. Mr Lyall said the work to place the rocks, each weighing up to six tonnes, could take a minimum of three-four weeks."}], "metadata": {"language": "en"}}
{"label": "Bolivia's President Evo Morales has now left the country after a controversial election there.", "prompts": [{"text": "His resignation on Sunday sparked clashes in cities across the country, according to local media reports. There have also been protests in several neighbouring countries over what's happened, with claims of corruption and foreign interference. But if you're coming to the story for the first time, there's a lot to take in. So if that sounds like you, let's start from square one and bring you up to speed. Bolivia basics Around 11 million people live in Bolivia, which stretches from the Andes mountains in the west to the Amazon rainforest in the east. You can see the national symbols on the country's flag - the condor and the llama. Bolivia gained independence from Spain in 1825 - and like much of south and central America - it now contains a mixture of people descended from both Spanish ancestors and the indigenous people of the area. But it's important to know that indigenous people make up around two thirds of the population. Dozens of indigenous languages are still widely spoken including Quechua which derives originally from the Inca people who ruled the region hundreds of years ago. From farmer to president Former coca farmer Evo Morales, 60, was elected to lead Bolivia in 2005 - the first president to come from an indigenous background. Back then, 38% of people there were classed as living in extreme poverty and he was praised for getting that figure down. He's left-wing, and nationalised the country's oil and gas industries. You can read more about his run as Bolivia's president here. So what sparked the current trouble? Some claim that after almost 14 years in power, Evo Morales shouldn't have been allowed to run for president again. But he was allowed to stand following a decision from the country's Constitutional Court. So before a single vote was cast on 20 October, this was a controversial election. When the count showed a win for Mr Morales, there were claims of corruption from supporters of his opponent Carlos Mesa. Then a monitoring group - the Organisation of American States - agreed there had been \"manipulation\" and called for the result to be cancelled. Crisis or coup? Protests turned ugly as the days mounted up with no clear election result - at least three people died in clashes. And it wasn't just a matter of holding a fresh election. Crucially, Evo Morales lost the support of Bolivia's armed forces, and was finally forced to quit at the weekend. That led him to describe what happened as a coup - a military takeover. His supporters clashed again with the police, while his opponents took to the streets to celebrate. International reaction President Trump says he \"applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom\". Russia, on the other hand, claimed Mr Morales had won the election but couldn't take power because of a \"wave of violence\". Mexico, which also has a left-wing leadership, echoed Mr Morales' claim of a coup. Mr Morales has now travelled to Mexico, claiming he'll return to Bolivia with more \"strength and energy\". So who's in charge now? The deputy head of Bolivia's Senate, Jeanine Áñez, has offered to take over as interim president until fresh elections can be held. But the atmosphere's tense, with the army now called in to back up the police against pro-Morales demonstrators. It's a delicately-balanced situation, with reports of looting and vandalism. Already, 20 people have been injured as fresh protests grow. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

{"label": "Almost 40% of the electricity generated in NI last year came from renewables, according to government statistics.", "prompts": [{"text": "By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent Power from about 82 wind farms in Northern Ireland was the main source. Figures from the Department for the Economy show that between April 2018 and March 2019, 38.6% of NI electricity was generated by those farms, and from the likes of biogas and biomass. It is a slight increase on last year's figure, edging closer to Stormont's target of 40% renewable energy by 2020. But separate statistics show that there has been a huge reduction in the number of renewable installations in the planning system. That has been put down to the ending of Northern Ireland's system of support payments and problems connecting to the grid. Some 58 renewable energy applications were received by planners in 2018 - the lowest figure since 2003/4. Most of them were for single wind turbines. At its peak in 2011/12, 820 renewables applications were submitted to planners. 'Incoming Economy Minister' At the time the Northern Ireland Renewable Obligation scheme provided subsidies to encourage investment in renewable generation. It closed to onshore wind in 2016 and all other technologies the following year. There is currently no replacement for the NIRO and a decision on whether or not Northern Ireland should join GB's Contracts for Difference - a system in which generators compete against one another for a government contract - has not yet been taken. It will be a matter for an incoming Economy Minister. Most of Northern Ireland's power generated from non-renewables comes from gas. But some coal is still imported every year for electricity generation. About a third of the 1.6m tonnes imported in 2018 was used for the purpose. Derry has the biggest power station generating electricity from renewable sources. The Lisahally Power Station uses wood diverted from landfill to produce enough power for 30,000 homes and businesses in the north west. The electricity it generates is bought on a long term contract by Power NI."}], "metadata": {"language": "en"}}

The 47-year-old from Newmarket, Suffolk, said the £4,900 he had raised was a \"thank you\" to all those working in the health service. \"There's never been a time when we've needed it more,\" he said. Mr Blowes decided on the challenge, which involved 2,000 laps of a 40-metre course in his garden, after seeing other people doing fundraising runs. He had been training for the South Downs Way 50, an ultra-race race from Worthing to Eastbourne in Sussex, which was cancelled a month ago. \"Running in my garden turned out to be much tougher than I realised,\" he said. \"I couldn't get into a rhythm and passing my living room window every 30 seconds wasn't easy. It was a long old slog.\" In 2017, Mr Blowes set a Guinness World Record for running the fastest marathon while carrying a household appliance, after completing the London course in five hours, 58 minutes and 37 seconds.
