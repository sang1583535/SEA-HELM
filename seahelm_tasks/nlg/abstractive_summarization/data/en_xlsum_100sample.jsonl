With his inauguration speech, he's already set the tone.", "prompts": [{"text": "By Kate DaileyBBC News Earlier this week, Trump posted a photo of himself sitting at a desk at Mar-a-Largo, a permanent marker hovering over a notepad. \"Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago. Looking forward to Friday,\" he tweeted. Trump vows to end 'American carnage' Trump's angry call to arms Full text of Trump's inauguration speech It's unclear whether the president-elect actually wrote the speech himself, but the content was pure Trump: the same populist message that resonated throughout the primaries and the campaign. \"Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,\" he said at the beginning of his remarks. For some on Twitter, it bore an eerie similarity to the Batman villain Bane's speech in The Dark Night Rises, so much so that someone posted a 10-second mash-up of the two. But such snarky reactions, warned Fox News commentator Guy Benson, underestimate how popular his rhetoric is with Trump supporters. \"People panning the speech still don't seem to understand how resonant the 'I will never ignore you' theme has been, and still is,\" he wrote, referencing Trump's many callouts to those who feel left out of American progress. Trump spoke of a country whose citizens had too long been ignored by the coastal elite: \"Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\" He painted a picture of a broken and damaged country, dotted with rusting-out factories \"like tombstones\", city streets plagued with \"crime and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives,\" and the wealth of the middle class \"ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world\". It was an unusually bleak speech for an inaugural address. One democratic strategist called it \"startlingly angry\". Conservatives were more mixed. According to MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, the speech was not intended to follow tradition: \"Donald Trump's speech was not an inaugural address. It was a primal scream aimed at Washington, DC.\" Author Hugh Hewitt called it \"authentic, determined, almost grim\". He wrote, \"I expected more joy, but it cannot be said that POTUS @realDonaldTrump said anything he hasn't said before. He has a plan and it's going to roll out fast.\" Others were sceptical of the breadth of those plans. Trump said the country was poised to \"free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow\", as well as \"eradicate from the face of the Earth\" radical Islamic terrorism. Writer Ben Shapiro expressed doubt about Trump's plans to both take power away from DC, and use his position as President to steer trade and create jobs. \"These cannot both be true,\" he wrote. Many also noted that it's easy to campaign as an outsider, railing about America's problems, but harder to lead, when one must find solutions. \"After three months in which Trump is president and it's still the same Washington, that speech is going to seem wildly imprudent,\" wrote Noah Rothman, assistant editor at Commentary Magazine. Commentator Mary Katherine Hahn thinks voters aren't interested in sweeping rhetoric. \"I am unabashedly ideological. The country is not. His message is populist & popular. His opponents dismiss that at their political peril.\" Pollster Frank Luntz said President Trump seemed to pivot, if not in tone then at least in substance: \"President Trump's inaugural speech was the best delivery I've ever seen from him.\" A more well-known conservative kept mum on his opinion. When the Washington Post asked George W Bush what he thought of the speech, he merely replied, \"Good to see you.\" One high-profile Twitter user was an unabashed fan. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted multiple times in favour of Trump's speech."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38697908", "title": "Trump inauguration speech: 'Angry', 'authentic', 'primal'"}}

But that compared with 6.5% for boys in 2016 and 44% of schools in England still send no girls at all to study the subject. The IoP said physics-based skills were essential for many future careers, from artificial intelligence to aerospace. However, the gender balance at physics A-level in England's schools has changed little in decades, with only 20% being female. \"There is no evidence to suggest any intrinsic differences in ability or interest to explain why girls and boys choose technical subjects differently,\" said IoP President, Prof Dame Julia Higgins. \"The consequences of girls' choices at school are that many rewarding and fulfilling routes are closed off to them.\" Snapshot The report, Why Not Physics? - A Snapshot of Girls' Uptake at A-level, found only 1.9% of girls chose A-level physics in 2016, compared with 6.5% of boys. In 2011, 1.6% of girls chose the subject, compared with 6.1% of boys. In contrast, 8% of girls and 12.3% of boys progressed to maths A-level. In subjects such as English and psychology, the trend is reversed, with far more girls than boys choosing the subjects. The report makes a number of recommendations: The IoP is hosting a summit on Thursday to tackle gender inequality in the classroom and to debate new ways to close the gender gap in the take-up of physics A-level. \"An ill-judged quip that girls 'can't do maths', or 'physics is too hard', can lead to girls making life-changing decisions that alter the subjects they study or the career they pursue,\" said Prof Higgins in a foreword to the report. \"Women in physics are still in the minority, and this lack of visibility preserves the myth and cements the fact that physics is simply not a subject for girls.\" Skills gap The lack of girls studying physics to a higher level also had consequences for the UK economy, the report said. Physics-based skills are required in many growth areas, from aerospace to artificial intelligence, and thousands more workers need to be trained every year to keep the UK economy competitive. A recent study found that closing the gender gap in physics would take hundreds of years, given the current rate of progress. Research analysing the names of authors listed on millions of scientific papers found physics, computer science, maths and chemistry had the fewest women, while nursing and midwifery had the most. Without further interventions, the gender gap was likely to persist for generations, said scientists from the University of Melbourne. Forecasts suggest it will take a very long time to close the gender gap in some fields, with predictions of 320 years for nursing, 280 years for computer science, 258 years for physics and 60 years for mathematics.

Speaking to the BBC Mr Allan said it was \"astonishing\" that 27 European countries could agree a \"lot more readily\" than UK politicians.

Mr Allan, who is also chairman of Tesco and house builder Barrett, said the CBI did not have a position on a second or confirmatory referendum. \"But my personal view is if the politicians can't get their act together and get to an agreement the only other option is to go back to the people and have a second referendum to see whether people still feel the same way now that they did almost three years ago and resolve it that way. \"One way or the other we have just got to break out of this impasse that we've got at the moment and get agreement. In a thinly veiled warning to MPs he said: \"It's astonishing that 27 European countries can agree on things a lot more readily than, frankly, our politicians. They should actually take a lesson from the solidarity the Europeans have shown over the last couple of years.\" Mr Allan said politicians needed to put their \"prejudices behind them\", and try to find a settlement in an \"open-minded way\". \"I think it would be great to erase red lines and for people to start thinking about the national interest as opposed to party interests or, as I think some politicians have been doing, their own personal self-interests.\" The withdrawal agreement was \"non-negotiable\", he said, adding that MPs had three choices: First, a no deal, which would be \"extremely damaging to the UK economy. I can't believe any sane politicians would like to do that\"; second, a compromise that a majority of MPs can agree on; third, revoke Article 50. \"Those are the only three options and it shouldn't take our politicians too long if they tackle it positively and sincerely to get to a solution to that.\" Separately, the CBI issued an official response to the extension of Article 50 until 31 October, which was agreed in Brussels in the early hours of Thursday. Director General Carolyn Fairbairn, said the extension had averted \"an imminent economic crisis\". However, she added: \"It needs to mark a fresh start.

Uncertainty had already caused serious damage, he said, with car plants on enforced shutdown, investment being cut and jobs being lost. \"This cannot go on.

Islington, Ms Thornberry's parliamentary seat, became less a borough than an abstraction, furthering a perception, according to Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, that the Labour Party \"has been hijacked by the north London liberal elite\".

It found in some areas, poorer students were up to five grades behind. The Department for Education says it provided over £530m in 2020-21 to support college students. Students from poorer families begin their A-level or vocational courses already behind more affluent students, and continue to fall further behind, according to analysis by the EPI. In the first ever study to measure the education \"disadvantage gap\" among students aged 16-19, provisional findings show that across all qualifications, poorer students are the equivalent of three A-level grades behind similar students from richer families. But there were variations across England, with poorer students the equivalent of around five A-level grades behind in areas including Knowsley on Merseyside, North Somerset and Stockton-on-Tees. In sharp contrast in many London areas, poorer students are level with or even slightly ahead of their more affluent peers. The EPI looked at students' free school meal status during their last six years of school and their attainment, based on qualifications and grades between the end of secondary school and by the age of 19. It finds the gap is bigger in A-levels than vocational qualifications. The researchers say there was no progress in closing the gap between 2017 to 2019, and suggest it is likely to get worse due the impact of the pandemic which has effected poorer communities more severely. Sam Tuckett, senior researcher at the EPI, said: \"For the very first time, this exploratory research gives us a clear understanding of how disadvantaged sixth form and college students are progressing with their learning compared to their peers. \"Our findings demonstrate very plainly that deep-seated inequalities follow poorer teenagers from school through to sixth form and college, and continue to widen further compared to otherwise similar students, as they work towards their qualifications.\" The big gaps in grades is largely explained by poorer students already having lower grades at the end of their GCSEs, the researchers say. Disadvantaged students are also more likely to take fewer and lower-level qualifications which adds to the gap in results. 'Learning losses' There is a \"strong case\" for extra funding for 16-19 education to stop poor pupils falling further behind, the report suggests. And targeted support is urgently needed to address learning losses caused by the pandemic, which is likely to impact the poorest students the most. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called for the pupil premium which gives extra money to schools to help poorer pupils, to be extended beyond the age of 16. \"Young people in England's school sixth forms and colleges have lower hours of teaching, less support and less enrichment than their peers in other countries, and less than those in private schools. That needs to change. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the report provides a welcome perspective on the \"chronic underfunding\" of sixth form education. \"There is now a broad consensus that young people need additional support to recover from the disruption to their education caused by Covid, but as this report illustrates, sixth forms and colleges have been helping students to recover from a range of disadvantages for many years.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We are determined to ensure disadvantaged students are properly supported while studying at college or sixth form so they can gain the skills they need to progress. \"This includes providing extra funding for disadvantaged 16 to 19-year-old students, specifically those with low prior attainment or who live in the most disadvantaged areas.\""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/education-56213402", "title": "A-levels: Poorer students 'three grades behind'"}}

At that point it forecast growth for 2016 would be 2% (which turned out to be right), rising to 2.3% for 2017 and staying there for 2018. It assumed that Britain would remain in the EU as that was official government policy. Then came the referendum, Brexit and the Bank's August Inflation Report - which will go down in history as the point of maximum exit fear at Threadneedle Street, the Gloomflation Report. The Bank slashed growth projections to 0.8% for 2017 and 1.8% for 2018, a huge downgrade which would have resulted - if the forecasts came to pass - in an economy billions of pounds smaller than previously projected. Substantial Since then, Mark Carney and the members of the Monetary Policy Committee have become much more chipper. In November, the Bank upgraded its growth forecasts by 0.6% for 2017, one of the most substantial increases it has ever published. Today that tone has continued, another substantial upgrade for this year and - as importantly - a small upgrade for next year which many believe will be the moment any negative Brexit effects actually start to crystallise as Britain enters the hard yards of the exit process. Does that mean the Brexit effect has disappeared? Not according to the Bank. It still believes - even with these substantial upgrades - that by 2019 the UK economy will be 1.5% smaller than it would have been had Britain voted to stay in the EU. And with a total gross domestic product of around £2 trllion, that's still a substantial sum. Though it should be pointed out that the figure is significantly better than the 2.5% it judged the gap would be last November. Dove The Bank still has plenty of warning lights flashing on the dashboard. Business investment is expected to fall. And the decline in the value of sterling has boosted inflation, with the Bank warning today that wage growth is likely to stall and consumer consumption - one of the key drivers of economic growth - slow. Interestingly, though, the Bank has become a little more doveish on the inflation issue as the pound has strengthened slightly over the last two months. And as the major retailers battle over market share, food prices are actually falling, not rising. Though the same cannot be said of fuel and input prices - that's the costs businesses pay for the products they use - which are both rising rapidly. Help Why has the Bank become much more bullish on the economy? First, the effects of stimulus measures taken after the referendum are starting to feed through. The Bank and the government have taken broadly expansionary policy positions over the last six months. The Bank has cut interest rates and provided more financial support - quantitative easing - for banks and businesses. Phillip Hammond's Autumn Statement relaxed deficit reduction targets and laid out plans to boost infrastructure spending. Beyond that, consumer confidence has remained robust as low interest rates have supported credit expansion and spending. That has maintained demand, which is good for an economy dominated by the services sector. With inflation rising, the Bank has become slightly more hawkish on the possibility of an interest rate rise this year or next. Which would be welcomed by many savers, if not mortgage holders. Trump Jump Second, Britain does not live in a Brexit bubble. The global economy is becoming stronger. Far from a Trump Dump, there has been a Trump Jump with businesses predicting that presidential promises of a fiscal stimulus to support infrastructure investment and tax cuts for individuals and firms will boost growth. The rest of Europe is also posting some better economic growth figures. Both have a positive effect on the UK economy, an exporting nation which is enjoying the fruits of a weaker currency. The Bank insists there is still a Brexit effect on the downside - and the Governor will be braced for more criticisms that the August report was simply too negative. Yes, the Bank is more chipper. But, it is still wary about the future."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38842721", "title": "Has the 'Brexit effect' disappeared?"}}

Until now, MPs who wanted to install security had to apply through the parliamentary expenses watchdog Ipsa. But the BBC's Norman Smith said MPs had decided to strip the watchdog of its authority over security decisions amid concerns over delays to MPs' requests. Following a decision by the Estimates Committee of MPs on Tuesday, all MPs will automatically be offered extra security - such as panic buttons, extra lighting, additional locks and emergency fobs - and will not have to apply to have them installed. Previously, MPs wanting enhanced security arrangements had to have to a risk assessment carried out by the police and written estimates before any work could be carried out. Jo Cox died last month after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency, the first MP to be killed for more than 25 years. The safety of MPs outside the Houses of Parliament is the responsibility of local police forces but Ipsa has responsibility for approving funding for security procedures and dealing with requests from individual MPs. 'Providing assurance' The watchdog's chairman wrote to MPs in the aftermath of Ms Cox's death to say the way in which it handled applications would be \"reviewed and accelerated\" in response to concerns about its role. In January, the security measures available to MPs at their constituency offices and homes were \"standardised\" - to try to speed up the process and ensure all 650 members of the Commons receive a consistent service. They were divided into two packages: routine and enhanced claims. The former is based on MPs filling in self-assessment forms although MPs must obtain two separate quotes from locksmiths. Those seeking additional protection in response to a specific threat must consult local police commanders who are expected to make recommendations based on a security and intelligence review. In 2014-15, £77,000 was spent on additional security measures designed to enable MPs to fulfil their duties following police recommendations. The Estimates Committee, responsible for financial and logistical support to MPs that has not been outsourced to Ipsa, is chaired by Commons Speaker John Bercow and its members include the Leader of the House of Commons and representatives from the main parties. A spokesperson for the House of Commons Commission, which supervises the overall running of the Houses of Parliament, said it did not publicly discuss the details of security arrangements and \"in the event that arrangements to MPs security are revised further, this information will be communicated privately to them\". An Ipsa spokesperson said: \"We have been working in partnership with the police and the House of Commons since last year to improve the security support available to MPs and their staff. We have recently streamlined the way we provide this support, responding to the security needs of MPs as defined by the police, while continuing to provide assurance about the public money spent.\""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36836980", "title": "MPs to be offered extra security after Jo Cox's death"}}

And he vowed 23 March's Budget would be the \"most pro-growth this country has seen for a generation\". But Labour accused Mr Cameron of \"warm words but no action\". Chancellor George Osborne has already told the Tory conference in Cardiff that his Budget will be \"unashamedly pro-growth\" and will include 10 new enterprise zones to boost some of the most deprived areas of England. 'Spark of initiative' Mr Cameron used his speech to reinforce his pro-growth message, and to promise a \"fundamental rebalancing of our economy\" with \"less debt, more saving; less borrowing, more investment; less dependence on financial services, more new industries, exports and trade\". With interest rates at a record low, and no money to spare, the prime minister said he wanted to champion the growth and ingenuity of the British people. He said: \"The spark of initiative. The courage to make your dream happen. The hard work to see it through. \"There's only one strategy for growth we can have now and that is rolling up our sleeves and doing everything possible to make it easier for businesses to grow, to invest, to take people on. \"Back small firms. Boost enterprise. Be on the side of everyone in this country who wants to create jobs, and wealth and opportunity.\" 'Social good' On a practical level, Mr Cameron promised to open up government procurement processes to more small businesses. \"I can announce today that we are taking on the enemies of enterprise. \"The bureaucrats in government departments who concoct those ridiculous rules and regulations that make life impossible for small firms. \"The town hall officials who take forever to make those planning decisions that can be make or break for a business - and the investment and jobs that go with it. \"The public sector procurement managers who think that the answer to everything is a big contract with a big business and who shut out millions of Britain's small and medium sized companies from a massive potential market.\" 'Reckless plan' Mr Cameron said \"enterprise is not just about markets - it's about morals too\", adding: \"We understand that enterprise is not just an economic good, it's a social good.\" And he said the Conservatives had always been a \"party of builders and businesswomen; electricians and engineers; roofers and retailers\". \"At its beating heart this is still a party of start-ups, go-getters, risk-takers. \"What drives us is getting things done - and what drives us mad is the bureaucracy, the forms, the nonsense getting in our way.\" It was speech that focused almost exclusively on domestic issues, but he did touch on Libya and repeated his call for Colonel Gaddafi to \"go\". He also urged Conservative activists to vote against changing the voting system in the referendum on 5 May. 'Reheated rhetoric' Labour has accused the Conservatives of lacking a strategy for growth and being more interested in grabbing headlines. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"When we urgently need a plan for jobs and growth to get the economy moving again and help hard-pressed families all David Cameron and George Osborne can offer is empty words but precious little action. \"All we've heard from this conference is the reheated rhetoric and warmed up policies of 30 years ago - a VAT rise, deep spending cuts, knee-jerk deregulation and enterprise zones which didn't work when they were tried in the 1980s. \"If David Cameron wants to know who is the real enemy of enterprise and growth in Britain today he only needs to look next door at his own chancellor. \"It is George Osborne's reckless plan to cut too deep and too fast, which has seen the economy go into reverse. \""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12657524", "title": "David Cameron says enterprise is only hope for growth"}}

The Asian-themed game is seen as an attempt to shore up WoW's dwindling subscriber base and cement its popularity in China. Competition time In early August it was revealed that the number of people playing World of Warcraft has dropped to its lowest level since 2007. In 2010, WoW claimed to have more than 12 million players but in June 2012 this had dropped to nine million. About half of these subscribers are believed to be in China. WoW creator Blizzard has tried several different strategies to keep people playing the game. It has introduced a version that is free to play in the early stages of the game. In addition, it let subscribers get a free version of its other hugely popular title Diablo 3, if they signed a 12-month contract for WoW. Part of WoW's decline has been put down to growing competition from other top tier games that have launched in recent months. Titles such as Star Wars: The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2, Diablo 3, Runescape and many other free to play games have all drawn players away from the ageing title. Mists of Pandaria is the fourth expansion for the massively multiplayer online game. Those who buy the expansion will get the chance to play as one of the Pandaren - the fighting pandas. The game also introduces a new character class to the game - the monk who uses martial arts rather than weapons to fight. As with other expansions, Blizzard is overhauling many other parts of the game at the same time as introducing Pandaria. The expansion will let players control ever more powerful characters; will see changes to the way characters improve their abilities; introduce short challenges for high level characters and let players pit their in-game pets against each other."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19700791", "title": "Fighting pandas set to join World of Warcraft"}}

The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: \"After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective. \"The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it.\" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'\" 'Super-sensitive' markets However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: \"It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment.\" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: \"This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late.\" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: \"We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. \"All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful.\" Subdued inflation However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: \"Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term.\" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: \"We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. \"Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer.\""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236", "title": "ECB warns stimulus programme still has a way to run"}}

It said losses had risen due to government delays in making oil companies use 10% bioethanol in petrol. The Department for Transport said it was \"on track\" to double the biofuels supply by 2020. Bioethanol is a renewable transport fuel which is blended with petrol to cut carbon emissions. It is made from organic matter including sugar, maize or, in the case of Vivergo, wheat. Vivergo's managing director, Mark Chesworth, told the BBC's Today programme that thousands of people could be affected by the stoppage: \"For 150 skilled workers on the banks of the Humber and the 3,000 people we support across the supply chain, many of them UK farmers, it's a very worrying time for the business.\" Petrol sold in the UK contains about 5% bioethanol, which Vivergo says results in carbon emissions savings equivalent to taking 180,000 cars off the road. Vivergo has called on the government to increase the amount of bioethanol in petrol to 10% by introducing a fuel called E10. The company - part of Associated British Foods - said that would mean emissions savings equivalent to taking 700,000 cars off the road. It said it had invested heavily in its Hull plant in the expectation ministers would introduce new rules forcing oil companies to increase the percentage of bioethanol in petrol. However, it said the delay in imposing that rule had meant that Vivergo's losses had increased, meaning it made \"more sense\" to stop production. Mr Chesworth said there had been too much political instability to bring the new rules in: \"There's been a series of delays in progressing that policy. Two general elections in the last two years, the EU referendum, four transport secretaries in the last four years - none of that helps to progress the policy.\" The company plans to carry out annual maintenance during the shutdown to \"maintain employment levels\". Vivergo employs 150 people, split between its plant in Hull and head office in Hessle, East Yorkshire. 'On track' In September, the Department for Transport said it would increase the use of renewable fuels in petrol and diesels from 4.75% to 9.75% by 2020 - known as the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. \"This will double the use of renewable fuels, reduce our reliance on imported fossil diesel, and deliver emissions savings equal to taking another one million cars off the road,\" it said. \"We are working closely with the industry and motoring groups to consider the issues around a potential introduction of E10 and the role government can play in this.\" Vivergo said it had welcomed the government's proposals to increase the use of renewable fuels, but \"remained concerned that there is no roll-out framework for E10 in the UK, the absence of which could have serious consequences for the long-term future of the UK bioethanol industry\". Mr Chesworth added: \"If the government does not increase the blend level to 9.75% and actively support the introduction of E10, the industry will be left in an unsustainable situation with excess capacity and there are likely to be casualties. \"I am not predicting that we will be one of them but with an unclear restart date, it is clearly concerning for all involved with Vivergo Fuels.\""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42226808", "title": "Biofuels plant in Hull stops production and may not reopen"}}

The Biden campaign rejected the claims. The Trump campaign adverts ask: \"Why won't Sleepy Joe commit to an ear test?\" and \"Who is in Joe's ear?\" Accusations that presidential candidates have received debate help via hidden hearing devices are familiar, albeit unproven. Such allegations have been levelled against both Republican and Democratic candidates in the past. Prior to Tuesday's debate, the rumour about Mr Biden's supposed earpiece was circulating on several social networks, and was being promoted by the Trump campaign. At least 15 versions The advertising campaign was launched after the debate, and also promotes two other baseless but widely shared rumours about Mr Biden. One suggested he asked for breaks during the debate, and another accused him of refusing a \"drug test\". The photo featured in the advert is not from Tuesday's debate. It was first shared online in September 2019. In a number of the adverts, it has been doctored to show Mr Biden wearing wireless Apple headphones. This was not the case in the original image. Some versions circle the ear featuring the headphone. By Wednesday evening, there were at least 15 different versions of the advert, and according to Facebook's Ad Library, they had reached at least 10 million users. Facebook has pledged to label posts containing voting misinformation and point users towards accurate information ahead of the election. However its policy does not involve fact-checking political speech, including in advertisements. The company declined to comment about the latest Trump ad campaign. Rumour origins Hours before the debate, the claims went viral on Facebook and YouTube. Identical memes were pushed by a number of popular Facebook pages with names such as US Conservative and Unhinged Left. They claimed \"Joe Biden should be inspected for a hidden earpiece as well as submit to a drug test before the debate\". These memes are subject to fact-checks - and some have had warning labels applied to them on Facebook. The claims were picked up by Fox News and other conservative news outlets. They were further amplified by supporters of QAnon, an unfounded a conspiracy theory that claims President Trump is fighting a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles. Those who believe in QAnon are known for promoting political disinformation on social media which targets opponents of the president. They shared close-up pictures of Mr Biden's ears, alleging a listening device was visible. During the debate, some also shared photos of a fold in Mr Biden's shirt, claiming it was caused by a wire, and of a supposed device on his wrist, where he wears a rosary in memory of his late son Beau. Nothing new Conspiracy theories about secret listening devices have been recycled in presidential election campaigns for the past two decades. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton faced similar unfounded claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In 2004, rumours circulated among left-wing sites and blogs that President George W Bush was being aided by a secret earpiece. None of those allegations were found to be true. Even if a candidate did wear an earpiece, any advantage would be questionable. As TV and radio presenters can attest, listening to someone while simultaneously talking during the back-and-forth of a live event is a difficult skill to master."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54360612", "title": "Trump ads push baseless Biden earpiece conspiracy"}}

A statement from the SPA said Mr Foley would be paid in lieu of his contractual notice as well as an early retirement payment. Earlier this year, Scotland's police watchdog had criticised \"dysfunctional\" relationships at the top of the SPA. A review by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland described a \"fundamental weakness\" at the board. Mr Foley's departure follows the announcement two months ago that SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan was to resign. The SPA statement said the role of chief executive has become redundant because of a change which will see the director of forensic services reporting directly to the authority's board. Future strategy Commenting on the decision that Mr Foley should leave, Mr Flanagan said: \"\"This new reporting arrangement is a further tangible step in strengthening oversight of forensic services, and will support work to develop a long-term strategy for forensics to complement the 2026 strategy for Police Scotland. \"I want to pay tribute to the professionalism which he has shown throughout our consideration of this, and indeed for the valued service he has given to SPA and policing over what has been a period of unprecedented change.\" The SPA said it is not possible \"at this stage\" to calculate a definitive figure for the financial settlement being offered to Mr Foley. It has, however, agreed with Mr Foley that the costs of the package will be made publicly available \"as soon as practical\" after his leaving date. Mr Foley said: \"The SPA has continued to evolve and improve since its inception in 2013 and strengthening the governance of Forensic Services is the next stage of that journey and one I fully support. \"Clearly the revised arrangements have significant implications for the CEO (chief executive officer) role I currently hold and following detailed discussions with the board since the start of the year I have chosen to seek early retirement. He added: \"I am confident that the authority and policing will continue to improve in the coming years and I want to thank all of the staff and officers who I have had the pleasure of working with over the past four years.\" Chief officer Although the CEO position is considered redundant, the SPA said it was seeking a 12-month secondee to act as chief officer for the SPA. The HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland report into the authority, authored by inspector Derek Penman, found \"positive signs of improvement\" in SPA board operations over the last 18 months, with improved relationships between the SPA and Police Scotland and the development of the Policing 2026 strategy described as a \"major milestone\". But it was highly critical of the approach which had led the SPA to meet in private. Mr Penman said the \"recent parliamentary scrutiny and media concerns over openness and transparency have weakened public confidence in the SPA and detracted from its ability to perform its statutory function\". He described the decision to hold meetings behind closed doors as \"precipitous\", and said it \"should not have been implemented\" until signed off by the board in full. Mr Penman welcomed the decision of the board to revert to holding meetings in public and publishing committee papers in advance, but wrote: \"I am aware that some board members continue to maintain that their decisions to implement private meetings and publish papers on the day of the board were essentially correct. \"There is a fundamental need to listen to the views of stakeholders to maintain public confidence, and on this occasion the SPA has failed to do so until pressed by parliamentary committees. \"The SPA must recognise the legitimate interests of parliament, local authorities, staff associations, the press and the wider public in the scrutiny of policing in Scotland.\" 'Gross misconduct' The SPA describes its role as \"to maintain policing, promote policing principles and continuous improvement of policing, and to hold the Chief Constable to account\".

{"id": "technology-51510196", "label": "It was the week when the mobile phone industry's biggest annual trade show was called off over fears about the spread of the coronavirus.", "prompts": [{"text": "Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we look at the fallout from the cancellation of Mobile World Congress - and ask whether social media has played a positive or negative role in helping people understand the threat posed by the virus. We've been in California this week - the podcast was recorded from the studios of KQED in San Francisco - and we've watched as the tech industry here has tried to get to grips with the threat posed by the coronavirus. At the beginning of the week, while major players like Ericsson and LG had pulled out of MWC, the general mood seemed to be that the show would go ahead. We took a trip across the Bay Bridge to Berkeley in search of some expertise. Fear spreads faster than infection There we found Dr Lee Riley, professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California - a man who has spent his career studying epidemics, including a spell at the World Health Organization. He was surprisingly sanguine about the coronavirus, pointing out that common-or-garden influenza was far more deadly, though he said he understood that uncertainty about the nature of the disease was bound to make people fearful. But he said a 24/7 news culture and the rise of social media made that fear spread faster than the virus itself - especially as the coronavirus was being diagnosed far more rapidly than Sars was 20 years ago. \"They do the diagnosis, and then we hear about the news of the diagnosis right away throughout the world instantaneously. They're constantly getting updates on this... and I think that feeds into some of the anxiety that people have.\" Social media was giving people partial information, but not all the facts, and that magnified their concerns. He seemed surprised when we told him there was talk of cancelling Mobile World Congress. He said that would be an \"over-reaction\". Even if people were attending the show from China, he said, \"we have new ways to diagnose these types of infections very quickly and accurately so that shouldn't be a concern.\" Feeling the heat at Samsung The following day, the mobile industry's market leader Samsung was launching its latest devices in San Francisco. On our way into the event – which, like MWC, had attracted visitors from around the world – we had to walk past a temperature sensor to screen us for fever, a symptom of the coronavirus. Inside, there were plentiful supplies of face masks and hand sanitiser. Then we got to see a spectacular show where the flagship Galaxy S20, now with 5G across all its versions, was unveiled. Having been under pressure from China's Huawei, which seemed to be leading the way on camera innovation, Samsung showed off a combined optical and digital 100x zoom which allowed the phone to pick out the Palace of Fine Arts where the event was taking place from a vantage point miles away, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. The star of the show, however, was Samsung's second folding phone the Galaxy Z Flip, a smaller and far more elegant device than last year's Galaxy Fold, even though the $1,380 (£1,058) price tag seems a bit steep just to be able to slip it into your jeans pocket. This was the second time Samsung had held its major event of the year before Mobile World Congress, previously the launch pad for its new Galaxy phones. Disappointment and disinformation That move looked even smarter the next day, when the news came through that MWC had been cancelled. That leaves its biggest Android rival Huawei with no venue to show off its latest devices - it had been planning to make a big splash in Barcelona. The leading analyst Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies, who is based in Silicon Valley, told us she was disappointed to be missing the show – an opportunity to get a global perspective on the industry. She made the point that a lot of the action takes place behind the scenes, with senior executives meeting and making deals. But the impact on the industry of cancelling the show was as nothing compared to the wider damage the virus could cause. \"It is nowhere near the impact that the coronavirus could actually have from a manufacturing perspective, from delaying products to lack of availability of products that are already in the market today,\" she said. Meanwhile, a World Health Organization official has been visiting the Silicon Valley tech giants this week to express concerns over the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus on social media. Standing outside Google's Mountain View headquarters, Andrew Pattison had this warning: \"The spread of misinformation, and false information about the virus itself is spread faster than the virus, and it's got into more people's lives and infected more people than the actual virus itself.\" Examples include people falsely claiming that eating garlic or taking vitamin C could ward off the disease, or changing credible websites such as that of the Canadian Health Ministry to insert false information about schools which had been affected by the coronavirus. But Mr Pattinson said there had been useful conversations with the tech firms, and Google had acted to remove misinformation from search results about the virus and replace it with content from reliable organisations such as the WHO. What is clear is that the coronavirus is going to have a major impact on many technology firms this year. Some will be trying to work out how to keep fragile supply chains intact as components from China become sparse. For others – notably the social media giants – the threat is of damage to their reputations if they are seen as the purveyors of panic and the channels for misinformation."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51510196", "title": "Tech Tent: Is social media spreading the virus?"}}

The take-up is 77% - 6% higher than in Scotland and 8% above Northern Ireland. Rhodri Williams, Ofcom director for Wales, said public funding to roll out the Superfast Cymru programme across Wales had \"transformed\" the picture. \"Things have improved due to the substantial amount of public investment that has taken place,\" he said, with financial backing coming from the EU, the UK and Welsh governments. But other findings in the report showed that Wales had the lowest availability of 4G services across the UK, with just under a quarter (23%) of adults having a 4G service in May 2015. Deputy minister for skills and technology Julie James welcomed the report and added: \"Fast and reliable internet connections are vital.\" The findings are part of Ofcom's 10th annual review of the communications market in Wales. Television The report showed people in Wales are the television addicts of the UK. On average they spend four hours 11 minutes watching TV a day - more than anywhere else in the UK. Despite people in Wales continuing to watch significantly more television than those in the UK as a whole, the average time they spent watching broadcast television declined by 12 minutes in 2014. And the report found the Welsh had more pay TV than anywhere else in the UK with seven in 10 households buying extra channels. The BBC's television services continue to perform better in Wales than in any other nation for reach, share, viewing hours and viewer appreciation scores. Internet and social media More than one in five Welsh adults said they were \"hooked\" on social media. Six in 10 adults in Wales have a tablet computer in the household compared to less than half (45%) last year. But internet users in Wales cited the laptop as their most important device for going online. Most internet users in Wales said they spend around 21.2 hours online per week with more than half of all Welsh internet users spending time on social networking sites on a weekly basis. The use of Twitter was higher among online adults in Wales (48%) than England (40%), Scotland (32%) and Northern Ireland (33%). More than eight in 10 online adults in Wales said they have used Facebook. Radio People in Wales consume more radio than the UK as a whole - and they listen for longer. In 2014, radio services reached 94.5% of the adult population in Wales. Wales continued to have the highest share (59%) of listening to BBC services and the lowest share of listening to local commercial radio (26%).

On Tuesday, Channel 4 News accused the officer of falsely claiming to have seen the events in an email to his MP. The Metropolitan Police Federation later strongly denied any \"conspiracy\". Channel 4 News alleged the police officer posed as a member of the public who witnessed the row in which Mr Mitchell was said to have called police \"plebs\". Mr Mitchell has always denied using the word but has admitted he had lost his temper and swore at the officers after they refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street. A spokesman for No 10 said of the latest claims: \"Any allegations that a serving police officer posed as a member of the public and fabricated evidence against a cabinet minister are exceptionally serious. \"It is therefore essential that the police get to the bottom of this as a matter of urgency.\" He added: \"We welcome [Metropolitan Police commissioner] Bernard Hogan-Howe's commitment to achieve that aim.\" John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents officers in the Met Police, said: \"The Metropolitan Police Federation unequivocally and categorically refutes any allegation that it was part of a conspiracy to unseat a cabinet minister.\" 'Utmost gravity' A Diplomatic Protection Squad officer was arrested on Saturday by officers investigating how national newspapers came to publish police records of the incident. Although the arrested officer was not on duty at the time, they claimed to have witnessed the incident - a claim now being probed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The Conservative MP told Channel 4 News he had been \"really shocked\" to learn of its allegations that the original newspaper coverage of the claim he had used the word \"pleb\" had been corroborated by the email from the officer pretending to be an eyewitness. \"I always knew that the emails were false, although extremely convincing,\" Mr Mitchell, MP for Sutton Coldfield, said. \"If you'd told me on 19 September [the night of the row] that the experience I have had since then, the revelations that have since come to light, could take place in Britain today, I simply would not have believed you. \"And it's certainly shaken my lifelong support and confidence in the police. \"I believe now that there should be a full inquiry so that we can get to the bottom of this, so that everyone can have confidence that this sort of thing won't happen again.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson said: \"An allegation that a serving police officer posed as a member of the public whilst fabricating evidence is a matter of the utmost gravity. \"I know that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is committed to establishing the truth here, as soon as possible.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Johnson's comments were the first time there had been suggestion of a conspiracy involving police officers. Channel 4 News broadcast CCTV footage which it said cast doubt on the official police log of the night of the row. The footage shows the MP with his bicycle talking to three officers by the main gate at Downing Street for about 20 seconds. He then wheels it over to the side gate and exits. Mr Mitchell said on Channel 4 News that his first reaction was \"there's not really much of an altercation\" when the story about his dealings with the police emerged. \"There were three phrases above all which were hung around my neck for the following 28 days every day in the press which were used to destroy my political career and were used to toxify the Conservative Party,\" he added. Before the footage was broadcast, Mr Hogan-Howe had told the BBC that he had seen no reason to doubt the original claims by the Downing Street police officers. MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said he planned to write to the Met commissioner to ask for a full explanation of what happened. 'Real injustice' Mr Mitchell told Channel 4 News he would never call anyone the name which he was accused of using, adding, \"anyone who know me well would know that it is absolutely not in me to use phrases like that\". Asked why he did not give a more detailed account earlier, Mr Mitchell said: \"Well, when the story broke, the decision was made that I would apologise for what I did say, and my apology was accepted; there was no police complaints and that we would let it lie. \"Now with the benefit of hindsight, that was clearly the wrong decision.\" Following the airing of the Channel 4 News report, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted: \"Incredibly concerned at v serious C4 Dispatches suggestion that A Mitchell was stitched up, never believed he used p-word anyway.\" Conservative MP David Davis told the BBC: \"He has suffered a real injustice. His reputation has been traduced, he's lost his job, his career's come to an end and to all intents and purposes that's pretty tough on the basis of something that may not now be quite the way it looked at the beginning.\""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-20775071", "title": "'Pleb' row: Andrew Mitchell claim is serious, says No 10"}}

As BBC South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas wrote at the time, Mr Temer, had \"always been a kingmaker, but never king\". In a series of carefully plotted moves, Mr Temer clearly positioned himself as a rival president. Ms Rousseff accused him of orchestrating a coup against her. Daniel Gallas described him as \"a skilled politician intent on ending the Rousseff presidency and beginning a new era in Brazil\". Although the Brazilian public did not hit the streets to protest against Mr Temer, his approval ratings stayed in single figures. Political scientist Carlos Melo described society as \"disenchanted and demobilised\" during the Temer tenure. In the October 2018 election, he was replaced by the far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bribery allegations Mr Temer was the first president in Brazilian history to have charges brought against him while still holding on to the top job. He was accused of being the head of a criminal organisation and of trying to obstruct the course of justice. Prosecutors said that back in 2006, when he was still a congressman, he created a bribery scheme that was still alive and well when he became president. His political group allegedly funnelled over 587m reais ($180m, £137m) from state-run institutions such as Petrobras and the Brazilian Lottery into the pockets of lawmakers. He was also accused of pressuring billionaire businessman Joesley Batista into buying the silence of two key witnesses that were co-operating with investigators from jail. Prosecutors said they had a mountain of evidence against Mr Temer, including video footage of a close aide of his receiving bags stuffed full of millions of reais in a restaurant in Sao Paulo. And two key witnesses have described how the ex-Brazilian president allegedly kept some of the bribe money for himself. Prosecutors say they even have a recording of Mr Temer listening to Joesley Batista brag about bribes the latter paid to judges and witnesses. Mr Temer has denied all the allegations, claiming he was the victim of \"coup plotters\" and survived two votes that stopped the investigations.

Their mother and sister both died from stomach cancer. The siblings, from Walsall, said the operation had saved their lives and \"eliminated\" the risk. However, Tahir's daughter has now been found to have the same gene. The siblings' mother Pearl Khan was 49 when she died 16 years ago, six months after she was diagnosed. Their 32-year-old sister Yasmin Khan died about six years ago. Tahir said: \"We didn't even think about genetic testing at that time but Sophia was very tenacious and worked with Cancer Research UK to get us all tested.\" The screening and tests for all four of the remaining siblings, including their other sister Tracy Ismail, 49, took from about 12 months to three years. 'Totally devastated' They identified three of them were carriers and each decided to undergo the operation as a preventative measure. Sophia had the operation first, followed by Tahir and Omar. Tracy, who was the only sibling to find out she did not have the gene, said: \"They told me my results first, so I just thought we would all be the same. \"It was very bittersweet. I was totally devastated. \"At one point we were told that if we hadn't had the testing done, I'd be the only sibling left. \"Knowing what my mum and sister had gone through and so quickly, I encouraged them to have the procedure done, and they're all still here.\" Sophia said: \"I read in my sister Yasmin's notes in hospital that they thought it may be genetic so I did some research and found out the hospital in Cambridge was doing a study with Cancer Research so I contacted them and went from there. \"Everyone thought I was mad until we had the results come back and when we saw it was three of us out of the four, I knew it was worth it.\" Sophia said she can \"still eat and do everything\" and added: \"The only issue is maintaining my weight and my vitamin deficiencies but in comparison to having stomach cancer and a few years to live, I can't complain. \"I even had a baby after the operation, they thought I might be malnourished or the baby would be tiny, but everything was absolutely fine.\" How can you have your stomach removed? Cancer Research UK said some tests are available for an inherited faulty gene that can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Tests for gastric cancer can include a blood test and chest X-ray, faecal sample testing, an endoscopy, ultrasound scan and laparoscopy. A gastrectomy is the name of the procedure of removing part or all of the stomach. During the procedure, a small pouch is created by connecting the gullet to either the small intestine or the remaining section of stomach. This means that the patient will still have a working digestive system, although it will not function as well as it did before. For about two weeks after the operation patients are fed through a tube into the vein, but eventually will be able to eat most foods and liquids. However, people who have had the procedure will need to eat more frequently and smaller portions, rather than three large meals a day, and take vitamin supplements to get the right amount of nutrition. Now, the food the siblings eat goes into a \"small pouch\" that was made by connecting the oesophagus to the intestine. \"I used to be 15st but now I'm only just over 10,\" Tahir said. \"I have to graze constantly because my body just can't get the nutrients it needs otherwise. \"My brother, on the other hand, he still eats like a horse.\" 'Best decision' Omar has a different view of the procedure. He said: \"At first after everything with my mum and sister I didn't want anything to do with hospitals or doctors or anything like that. \"But seeing my Sophia go through the procedure and have a baby afterwards, I thought 'I've got no excuse'. \"It was a really hard decision for me but it was the best one I've ever made. \"I still can eat whatever I like - burgers, steaks - the only thing I get is exhaustion and cold sweats but I'm still breathing and I'm so thankful for that.\" However, Tahir's daughter, Farah, who is 21, has since tested positive for the gene too. He said: \"I am worried about my daughter's future, but I say to her we have all gone through it and are fine now, so whatever happens she'll be OK.\" Tahir underwent his surgery five and a half years ago after his test found he had clusters of cancerous cells in his stomach lining. \"They said I effectively had cancer but because it was contained in my stomach lining and I had all that removed, it eliminated it. I could have had only days, weeks, maybe a year maximum left before I would have been diagnosed with terminal cancer. \"There's no doubt in my mind that having the tests and the procedure done saved my life.\" Dr Marc Tischkowitz, consultant physician in medical genetics at the University of Cambridge, said: \"This is a very rare, specific type of stomach cancer. \"It's a gene that carriers can have for their lifetime and means that they are at risk of developing cancer any time.\" He said the stomach removal was \"a dramatic life-changing procedure\" and said there was \"no way of knowing in all cases that the person who carries the gene will 100% have developed cancer in their lifetime\". Georgina Hill, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"It's estimated only 3-10% of cancer cases are linked to an inherited faulty gene. \"Anyone worried about their genetic cancer risk should talk to their doctor, who can refer those with a strong family history of certain cancers to a genetic counselling clinic if appropriate.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-47374127", "title": "Walsall siblings' stomachs removed over cancer risk"}}

Hackers broke into film company Sony's computers, and weeks later threatened to target any cinema which screened the film. An FBI investigation concluded that North Korea was to blame for the cyber attack. North Korea responded angrily, with Kim Jong-un calling President Obama a \"monkey\". What do we know about his ambitions? Four insiders offer their insight into what Kim Jong-un wants. 'Survival': Foreign journalist Jean Lee Jean Lee was born in America to South Korean parents and grew up hearing stories about Korean families separated by the war in 1953. A few years ago, she became the first foreign journalist to open a bureau inside North Korea. She was in the crowd when Kim Jong-un was first introduced to the Korean people at a military parade, and says he has had to work hard to establish his own power base. \"When he came out there was just a complete sense of shock and awe among the people at the plaza. They had never seen a picture of him. They had only really known of his existence, officially, a few weeks earlier. \"It was quite a shock to see somebody so young who was being groomed to be the next leader. He was not the oldest son, so wasn't the obvious shoo-in. There's clearly something about him, ambition, perhaps a kind of ruthlessness, some qualities that his father saw in him that he thought would carry this country into the next generation.\" The world saw that ruthlessness a year ago, when he ordered the execution of his uncle for allegedly trying to overthrow the state. And the regime is known to use violence to quash dissent among ordinary people too. But Jean Lee says it would be a mistake to think Kim Jong-un maintains control only through fear: \"One of the things that I've seen on the ground over the past couple of years is all the construction of these skating rinks. There's actually a skateboard park, the ski resort of course that opened last year, massive projects. I see all of this as an investment that they're making in their future. He is a young man. If he is going to win the support of the future generations of North Koreans who are going to be his power base, he's got to find a way to win their loyalty and this is part of that.\" 'A stronger economy': Businessman Geoffrey See Geoffrey See is a Singaporean who has been travelling back and forth to North Korea for the past seven years, working with young entrepreneurs. He says North Koreans are now thinking more innovatively about the economy: \"About six years ago when we first started our programme, our counterparts would often start off with a very long spiel about socialism and how this is the system they have and they are never going to change it. \"In recent years instead of saying that, people talk about... trying to bring in what's best from overseas, and try to adjust it to fit into the system. So I think that's a very interesting change in terms of thinking.\" Where this new investment is being targeted is also interesting. \"If you look at the economic zones that North Korea was investing in, one of the key areas is Wonsan. So this is an economic zone on the east coast of North Korea. It faces Japan and it borders South Korea. So it is kind of almost the furthest location you can have from China. So we believe that it's part of this broader aim to balance off Chinese economic influence in North Korea.\" Kim Jong-un has also been making overtures to Russian President Putin. Two years ago, Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea's debt. But Geoffrey See says there aren't many foreign investors willing to engage with the country's idiosyncratic business environment: \"We would email the North Koreans two, three, four times and we [wouldn't] get a response, and we used to get very worried about it. We wondered if they are reading our messages, if things are moving ahead. \"We would go in like three months later from the first set of emails. When we meet with them we ask them, 'Did you receive our emails?' The response is always like, 'Oh, you are coming in three months' time, we didn't feel the need to send a response because we can just chat when you're back in here'.\" 'The big prize: reunification': Supporter Kim Myong Chol Kim Myong Chol was born and lives in Japan, but is ethnically Korean. He has been to North Korea more than 20 times in the last 40 years, and says he has met representatives of the country's elite as well as, in his words, the two Kims - Kim Jong-un's father and grandfather. He hasn't met the third Kim yet, but praises his \"guts, determination and intelligence\". Some describe Kim Myong Chol as an unofficial spokesman for the leader. \"What makes him different from the two Kims,\" he argues, \"is that he will succeed in getting what he wants. The reunification of Korea, without foreign interference. Eventually the US will leave Korea and the Korean peninsula will be re-unified. \"[The US will] realise the futility, the senselessness of American military presence in Korea. North Korea [will] become too strong for America. We have now nuclear weapons, we have intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have hydrogen bomb. \"We are victims of American aggression. North Korea is a most sanctioned country. Brutalised, criminalised, isolated by America.\" He insists Kim Jong-un's unpredictable behaviour is part of his strategy to fight back: \"North Korea is a very small country. The USA is a big country with nuclear weapons. How to defeat the enemy? Outsmart them. That's the only way North Korea can survive, outsmart America.\" 'Friendly neighbours': China analyst Yanmei Xi Yanmei Xie is senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group in Beijing. She argues that Kim Jong-un can do little without China's support. \"North Korea relies on China for survival. If China cut the fuel supply across the Yarlu River which is between North Korea and China, then the regime... will collapse in a matter of weeks. So Beijing plays a very crucial and vital role in the Korean Peninsula.\" And when North Korea does something that China doesn't like, its punishment is swift and exact: \"When there were reports and intelligence saying North Korea could be on the brink of a fourth nuclear test, China slowed down fuel supply and food aid. \"But before it did that, China looked into the fuel supply and harvest of grain and calculated the amount of reduction in order to make sure that the reduction would not cause instability. [This] was meant to send a signal of displeasure but not to destabilise the regime or cause real pain.\" This is because China also needs its neighbour: North Korea stands between China and the 28,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea. \"North Korea used to be a military buffer for China in terms of heading off any potential advance of US armies. Now in the age of naval and air dominance of United States, a land war is not as important, but North Korea remains a political buffer in that it is a buffer between China and South Korea, which remains a US ally. \"So China shares interest of managing Kim Jong-un.

The decision will end recent speculation as to whether the entire Saudi team could have been disqualified on grounds of gender discrimination. The public participation of women in sport is still fiercely opposed by many Saudi religious conservatives. There is almost no public tradition of women participating in sport in the country. Saudi officials say that, if successful in qualifying, female competitors would be dressed \"to preserve their dignity\". In practice this is likely to mean modest, loose-fitting garments and \"a sports hijab\", a scarf covering the hair but not the face. For the desert kingdom, the decision to allow women to compete in the Olympics is a huge step, overturning deep-rooted opposition from those opposed to any public role for women. As recently as April, the indications were that Saudi Arabia's rulers would accede to the sensitivities of the religious conservatives and maintain the ban on allowing women to take part. But for the past six weeks there have been intense, behind-the-scenes discussions led by King Abdullah, who has long been pushing for women to play a more active role in Saudi society. 'Subtle reform' In secret meetings in Jeddah, officials say a consensus was reached in mid-June between the king, the crown prince, the foreign minister, the leading religious cleric, the grand mufti and others, to overturn the ban. An announcement was ready to be made but then had to be delayed as the country marked the sudden death of Crown Prince Nayef. \"It's very sensitive,\" a senior Saudi official told the BBC. \"King Abdullah is trying to initiate reform in a subtle way, by finding the right balance between going too fast or too slow. \"For example, he allowed the participation of women in the Shura council [an advisory body] so the Olympic decision is part of an ongoing process, it's not isolated.\" The official acknowledged that to refuse to let women take part would have looked bad on the international stage. \"Partly because of the mounting criticism we woke up and realised we had to deal with this. We believe Saudi society will accept this,\" the official said. It is not the first time a Saudi monarch has backed a controversial reform against domestic opposition. King Faisal, who introduced television in the 1960s and was eventually assassinated, insisted on introducing education for girls. Today, Saudi women graduates outnumber their male counterparts."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18571193", "title": "London 2012 Olympics: Saudis allow women to compete"}}

He is on trial in New York, accused of making millions from the site where drugs and other illegal commodities were bought and sold. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him. And Mr Ulbricht has never admitted that he ran the site. Hidden site The charges against Mr Ulbricht include accusations of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking. Prosecutors claim the site generated over a million untraceable drug deals and earned Mr Ulbricht $18m (£11.9m) in bitcoin commissions under the online handle Dread Pirate Roberts. He could face life in prison if found guilty on all charges. At the scene - Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York Listening to opening arguments, it was impossible not to think of the cinematic possibilities of the Silk Road story. Take the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, in a San Francisco public library in 2013 while he was allegedly chatting online with someone he thought was a colleague but was in fact an undercover federal agent. With agents moving in fast to seize his computer, he was caught red-handed, the jury was told, with his fingers on the keyboard. Or consider the hit men he allegedly hired to kill those who posed a threat to the digital drugs empire - not that the prosecution claims anyone was actually murdered. There is the intrigue of the dark and shadowy part of the internet which Silk Road made its home. And there is the vast scale of the operation, which not only targeted a neighbourhood or city but the entire world, supposedly offering an online safe haven for drug dealers where they could conduct untraceable deals. Then there are the boasts which the 30 year old Ulbricht allegedly made: \"I am Silk Road.\" Mr Ulbricht is also accused of soliciting murders to help silence people who knew about the site and his involvement with it. There is no evidence that any of the murders were carried out. The New York trial will not deal with the murder plot charges but evidence relating to them will be presented in court. The Silk Road shut down in October 2013 following raids by the FBI and other US law enforcement agencies. The market operated from January 2011 to late 2013 during which time, the US alleges, tens of thousands of people used it to trade many different types of drugs, acquire forged documents and buy and sell hacking services. The Silk Road operated as a \"hidden service\" on the Tor dark web network allowing people to use it anonymously. Anonymity was also aided by payments for drugs and other services being carried out in bitcoins. More than 29,000 bitcoins seized during the 2013 raid were sold by US marshals in June this year for $17m (£11m). The FBI is believed to be in possession of a larger hoard of bitcoins seized from the site. Mr Ulbricht's family and friends have set up a website to help defend him saying he is innocent of all charges and had nothing to do with the Silk Road and its operation. A documentary called Deep Web has been made about the case, Mr Ulbricht's treatment and how the FBI tracked him down. It is due to be shown later this year. Supporters say the case has serious implications for online freedom because of the way it has been handled. Since the Silk Road shut down, other hidden sites have sprung up to take its place. One, called Silk Road 2.0, has been shut down due to raids by law enforcement agencies and the arrest of the man believed to be its operator."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30795245", "title": "US trial of alleged Silk Road creator begins"}}

If you had two major pieces of work to do each year, you would not decide to do one in December and one in March, but that's what the OBR has to do. In its report accompanying the Budget it complained that its already tight timetable had been made harder by government departments handing in their homework at the last minute. \"We were not given details of costings for a large proportion of significant policy measures until just before our deadlines,\" the report said. Now, this ranks as a relatively minor whinge, but the gloves came off for the complaints in the OBR's news conference. The trouble is, the OBR has to make forecasts based on how much it thinks the government is going to spend in years for which there are not yet detailed departmental spending plans, which currently applies to the period after April 2016. 'Complex and opaque' It does this based on what's called the medium term spending assumption. And OBR chairman Robert Chote is not best pleased about it. \"Back in 2011 we could explain the government's spending assumption in our EFO [economic and fiscal outlook] in just 29 words,\" he told reporters. Users of the BBC News app tap here for the Budget Calculator. \"It has now become so complicated that it requires 428 words.\" If you read through it, it is pretty difficult to get your head round, with lots of detail about whether or not it is taking into account the \"life-length of roads\" and \"depreciation for Network Rail\". And the problem is that what the government puts in its spending assumption is really important. At the moment, we only have detailed spending plans for the first year of the next parliament. We're relying on the spending assumption to work out spending in the other four. \"It's unfortunate that this assumption has become so complex and opaque because in an era of fiscally neutral Budget and Autumn Statement scorecards it's become the main mechanism by which the government achieves the outcomes for the Budget balance that it wants to see across the forecast,\" Robert Chote said. The OBR report shows that the impact of changes to Budget measures are absolutely dwarfed by the effect of changes to the spending assumption. In other words, most of the movements in the forecast come from a complicated set of assumptions for years in which there are no proper spending plans. And to have the head of the OBR condemning parts of the process as \"opaque\" is a real problem for the government, which created the OBR to become more transparent and prevent governments from fiddling the figures."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31949307", "title": "Headline numbers: Feeling the OBR's pain"}}

They hope to launch the new Funeral Expense Assistance benefit by the summer of 2019. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said she was taking \"decisive action\" over what was a \"growing issue\". The cost of burials and cremations has been on the rise, studies have shown. In 2016 a basic burial, on average, cost more than £1,300, excluding undertakers fees, while the average local authority cremation cost £670. A 2016 study by the Stirling Citizens Advice bureau found there had been a steep rise in so-called \"paupers' funerals\", which cost local authorities £500,000 in the previous year. The new benefit is part of a 10-point plan which commits the government to a range of actions over funeral costs. It includes a range of advice services, including guidance on funeral costs, consumer protection in relation to funeral plans, a Social Innovation Fund to tackle funeral poverty and the pilot of a \"funeral bond\" to help people save up for their own burial. 'Increased difficulties' Ms Constance said the government was committed to \"supporting those who need it most following a bereavement\". She said: \"The death of a loved one is an incredibly difficult time for anyone. It can be even harder when money is tight. We know funeral costs can push people into poverty - and often it is those already in financial hardship who face increased difficulties. \"That is why we are taking decisive action to tackle this growing issue and have engaged with local authorities, the funeral sector and other support services. I am pleased by the willingness to work together to find solutions that support more affordable funerals.\" The Scottish government held a national conference on funeral poverty in November 2016, and has hosted a series of round-table discussions on the issue. The plans were also informed by a report by the Scottish Working Group on Funeral Poverty. The group's chairman John Birrell said he was \"increasingly concerned\" about rising costs, saying bereaved relatives would experience \"more and more distress\" if action was not taken."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40855469", "title": "Plan for new benefit to tackle Scots 'funeral poverty'"}}

What are the big ideas and spending commitments?", "prompts": [{"text": "Taxes Income tax - a new five-band regime came into force last year and the finance secretary has decided to maintain the current rates. He will increase the starter and basic rate thresholds by inflation in a move designed to help the lowest paid. However, the Scottish higher rate threshold has been frozen - unlike in the rest of the UK where the threshold will go up to £50,000 from April - which Mr Mackay said would raise an extra £68m in revenue. The move means the divergence between the income tax regime in Scotland and the rest of the UK continues to grow. This was confirmed when MSPs voted to back the Scottish rate resolution by 61 votes to 52 on Tuesday, and the changes will kick in from the start of the new tax year in April. Other taxes Elsewhere, the replacement system for stamp duty in Scotland (Land and Buildings Transaction Tax) is also being revamped with the amount that buy-to-let investors or holiday home buyers pay on a second residential purchase going up from 3% to 4%. The Scottish government's Small Business Bonus Scheme is maintained, while the non-domestic poundage rates paid by businesses will see a\" below-inflation increase\". Local authorities will be allowed to increase council tax levels by up to 4.79%, and there will be cross-party talks about ways of replacing the council tax in the next parliament. Spending Health was the big winner with the Scottish government proposing an increase of almost £730m in health and care services, with much of the money being passed on in so-called \"Barnett consequentials\" from Westminster as a result of spending commitments by the UK government south of the border. Education spending saw a real-terms increase including a £180m pot to raise standards in schools. Almost £500m has also been committed to aid the expansion of the early learning and childcare sector. Support for business comes in the shape of £5bn commitment for capital investment to be spent on modernising Scotland's infrastructure, including a new £50m fund for regenerating run down high streets. Initial funding of £130m towards the establishment of a Scottish National Investment Bank has also been earmarked. Public sector pay increases of 3% for those earning up to £36,500 have also been proposed, while those who earn between £36,500 and £80,000 will see their wages increase by 2%. Separate to the draft budget, it has been announced that MSPs will receive a 2.3% increase taking their salaries to £63,579. Mr Mackay also said Scotland's 32 local councils will receive a real terms increase in both revenue and capital funding, taking the local government budget to £11.1bn. The Scottish government has also committed more cash to the £2.9bn justice budget, claiming the police resource budget will be protected in real terms. What else has he announced? Other spending proposals in the document: £2m has been set aside to tackle \"food insecurity\" in the school holidays, while £5m will go towards supporting 2,000 women return to work following a career break. Elsewhere, the government's external affairs budget - which \"supports the promotion of Scotland and its interests at home and abroad\" - will increase from £17.2m to £23.9m The \"Government Business and Constitutional Relations\" budget has increased from £2.4m to £12.1m Spending on the provision of free sanitary products in public places is proposed to jump from £1.2m to £2.8m next year. The public agency for checking criminal records, Disclosure Scotland, sees its budget drop from £14.8m to £11.4m. Highlands and Islands Enterprise sees its budget fall by £10m to £61. The state-owned Glasgow Prestwick airport will be loaned another £6m in 2019-20, taking the amount of public money tied up in the Ayrshire airport to over £50m. Fiscal forecasting The independent economic forecaster the Scottish Fiscal Commission has produced forecasts on economic growth for the coming years and is predicting economic growth of 1.4% this year and 1.2% in 2019, which it says reflects \"stronger recent economic performance, a more positive prospect for earnings over the next few years\". The commission forecasts that £15.2bn of the Scottish Budget will be raised by devolved taxes in 2019-20. Income tax raises the most revenue, forecast to be £11.7bn in the next financial year. The Green deal After talks went down to the wire, Mr Mackay secured support for his plans from the Greens just hours before the stage one vote on the budget. The agreement will see the Greens back the minority SNP government for the third year in a row. It includes: Some of the changes - like the tourism tax and workplace parking levy - will not take effect in the coming year, but will be incorporated into future budgets."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46541974", "title": "Scottish budget: At a glance"}}

A Newsnight report had led to Thatcher-era Tory Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse. The programme had previously shelved a sex abuse investigation into BBC TV presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile. Lord Patten, appearing before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said Mr Entwistle had asked him if the BBC Trust - the corporation's governing body - was \"urging him to go\". He was told: \"We are not urging you to go. But we are not urging you to stay.\" Lord Patten said Mr Entwistle and his lawyers insisted he would not leave with six months pay and he said the director general had asked for more than the 12 months pay he eventually got. \"He wanted to go on 12 months and more,\" he told the committee. Questioned about how much Mr Entwistle had asked for, he said: \"He didn't ask for two years but he did ask for more.\" Lord Patten said there had been feverish negotiation on 11 November and he took advice from the BBC's lawyers. He said they told him that if the pay-off deal was refused, Mr Entwistle could go to an industrial tribunal and would stand to win an extra £80,000 on top of the £450,000. Lord Patten said: \"We did not have grounds for dismissal. We could either accept a consensual deal for 12 months, or the situation would drift on and we would find ourselves with a constructive dismissal (claim) and also an unfair dismissal.\" He also said that if Mr Entwistle was found to have done anything in breach of his contract, \"we can claw back some of the remunerations that has been paid\". 'Decent man' Referring to Mr Entwistle, Lord Patten said he refused to \"trash a decent man\" who had been \"overwhelmed\" by events. He added that he \"wondered by the end of it how much his heart was in it. I think he found the whole thing an appalling experience\". Earlier, Lord Patten told the MPs the BBC must not \"abandon or resign from investigative journalism\" because of the mistakes made by Newsnight. He said there was a need for a \"belt and braces\" approach to make sure such \"shoddy journalism\" was not repeated. But he added: \"The BBC must not abandon or resign from investigative journalism. It's important that your journalistic standards are even higher for investigative journalism.\" Some of the other key exchanges included: The BBC has been mired in controversy since October - on 2 October, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon blogged about why an investigation into sex abuse allegations involving former BBC DJ and television presenter Savile had been shelved in December 2011. The following day ITV aired a documentary which included serious allegations about the presenter, who died in October 2011. This led to a stream of allegations about Savile's behaviour during the 1970s, 80s and 90s, when he was a household name in Britain as the presenter of the BBC's Jim'll Fix It. On 2 November, Newsnight aired a programme in which Steve Messham, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wrexham, claimed he had been abused by an unnamed senior politician of the Thatcher era at the home. It subsequently emerged he had wrongly identified to Newsnight the former Conservative Party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, as being one of his abusers. Although Lord McAlpine was not named in the programme, his name emerged on the internet and he then came out in public to angrily deny being involved. A BBC inquiry later said some of the basic journalistic checks had not been completed; identification was not confirmed by photograph with Mr Messham, and no right of reply was offered to Lord McAlpine. And the BBC paid £185,000 in libel damages to the peer. Last week Tony Hall, a former BBC news executive who spent the last decade running the Royal Opera House, agreed to become the next director general early next year. Lord Patten said he was \"greatly looking forward\" to working with Lord Hall. He said: \"The biggest task we face is restoring trust. Trust in the BBC has taken a knock. \"The BBC is still trusted more than any news organisation but that is not a statement of complacency because we have shot ourselves in the foot. We have to rebuild that trust.\" For his part, Mr Davie said the BBC needed to be more transparent and \"slightly more humble\"."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-20509003", "title": "Lord Patten defends BBC pay-off to George Entwistle"}}

So much stuff was dumped that staff could not open the shop and the furniture was ruined in the rain. Barnardos had to pay to remove the items. The council says similar incidents by others had already prompted some charity shops to put up signs warning that items will be considered fly-tipping if left after premises shut. 'Serious offence' The council said Ronnie James Carroll, 47, admitted four offences under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 at Carmarthen Magistrates Court. The authority says he was fined a total of £420 (£105 for each offence) as well as prosecution costs of £567.23, £60 in compensation to Barnardos and a £20 victim surcharge. The council said the offences occurred in September and October of last year and so much furniture was left on a second occasion that staff found it difficult to open the shop.

The BBC's Roman Lebed and Tom Santorelli speak to Ruslan Gritsaylo about how he set up a business taking people on paratrike tours in the skies above Kiev.", "prompts": [{"text": "\"My business is to fly,\" says 40-year-old Kiev resident Ruslan Gritsaylo, who really does look like a man who loves his job. Every week he takes customers up in the air on his tiny aircraft known as a paratrike. A cousin of the microlight, paratrikes look like a tricycle tractor with a huge propeller mounted behind, as well as a big parachute which rises into the sky on take-off. At first sight it may be difficult to believe that this vehicle can make it into the air, but these doubts quickly eat the dust when the vehicle breaks away from the earth. Piloting in the blood Mr Gritsaylo is a third generation pilot. His grandfather flew during World War II, and his father was a pilot in the 1970s. He himself flew sports aircraft and was trained as civil aviation pilot. When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, he realised he could make good money by piloting flights on his own. \"My dear wife Aliona is joking with me: your hobby became a business, and then your business became a hobby. It's all about love,\" says Mr Gritsaylo. When he started his business in the 1990s, there was not much competition. There was not enough information about paratrikes - how to construct them or how to fly them safely - so it was a rather dangerous business. This changed over time as the technology improved, making flights on the micro-vehicles completely safe and civilised, according to Mr Gritsaylo. \"It still can be considered as an extreme sport, but it is more about endorphin then adrenalin,\" he says. \"It's more about enjoying it rather than being scared of it. The definition of paratrike is one of the safest flying machines ever created by man.\" Between the lines of the law In a country well-known for its love of red tape, securing permits to fly paratrikes proved complicated. Mr Gritsaylo found that many laws in the aviation sphere contradicted each other, and it was very difficult to properly legalise the business for a small private company. \"There are lots of things, which make no sense. \"For example, people come and ask, show me your papers. I say, what kind of papers? and they say, well your pilot licence. \"I have six pilot licences all over the world, but I don't have Ukrainian, because there is no company legally providing official pilot licences for this kind of ultra-light flying machine,\" he says. So his biggest problem became his biggest opportunity: because of imperfect legislation his aircraft does not require registration. Otherwise, he would have had to get 11 different permits, which would have been almost impossible. \"It's a balance between 'yes' and 'no' - it's 'maybe'. And between the borders of this 'maybe', you can do everything. We are between the lines of the law.\" Mr Gritsaylo carries several thousand customers every year. They stand in line to fly during weekends. Ten minutes in the sky costs about $60 (£37) - for Ukraine, that is quite a lot of money, but he spreads his net wide to catch customers by using social media and maintaining his own website. \"I follow the rule of big figures - you make lots of calls, lots of e-mails, lots of people. Lots of money,\" says Mr Gritsaylo, whose phone rings almost every five minutes. AirForia euphoria His clients are made up of a wide range of people - bankers, office managers, artists, actors - and often people buy certificates to fly as gifts for each other. People get their biggest kick from night-flights, otherwise known as open-space flights. Mr Gritsaylo likes to call himself The Man who Brings Happiness. He even named his aero club AirForia, a play on euphoria. He says that after he started taking people up into the sky he needed to diversify his business model, and now he advertises insurance companies and other companies on his parachutes, flying their banners through the skies and performing paratrike tricks during airshows. \"Take a bottle of milk. How can you earn money with a bottle of milk? Advertise it with an airplane! Where, when, with whom - these are the questions. But every question has an answer. You have to find the connection between the airplane and something you see around\". Mr Gritsaylo also purchased equipment so he could produce high-quality videos of the flights. He sets the camera right on the nose of his aircraft and claims that he can take better pictures than helicopters can. \"Every year you must make some step forward, because there are lots of people walking behind you. And they are trying to step on your toes. If you don't go forward - they will walk on top of you,\" says Mr Gritsaylo, with a huge smile on his face."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-18074966", "title": "My Business: Taking to the skies in Ukraine"}}
{"id": "uk-northern-ireland-40941393", "label": "The government has said there must be an \"unprecedented solution\" for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit.", "prompts": [{"text": "A paper detailing its proposals focuses on the need to avoid a hard border. The government stresses there should be no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts, at the border, which has almost 300 crossing points. Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as \"a fantasy frontier\". The government's paper does not envisage CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it. Instead, the government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit. The future management of that border is a highly sensitive issue and is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland Office officials say 80% of firms in Northern Ireland are small or medium sized and engaged in local business rather than international trade. If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade. Such firms might be required to declare their import and export businesses online. The government has repeated its desire to maintain the Common Travel Area and the rights of UK and Irish citizens, and to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, of which the UK is a co-guarantor. Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to reassure nationalists living in Northern Ireland. \"No one voted to end the special ties between the UK and Ireland, or to undermine the unique arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland which have underpinned the peace process and have been in place well before our membership of the EU,\" she said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he broadly agreed with the position paper's \"aspirational\" principles. \"They reflect a lot of the language that the Irish government has been using, actually, in terms of maintaining the status quo, frictionless borders,\" he said. Designed to reassure the European Union Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels Reporter The European Commission responded to the publication of the UK paper by saying there had to be a political deal to protect the Good Friday Agreement before a discussion could begin on technical measures. The paper is full of language and examples designed to soothe the EU about its worries. Michel Barnier said the Good Friday Agreement must be guaranteed. The UK said it would be. The Common Travel Area, which allows free movement between the UK and Ireland, is enshrined in an EU Treaty and letting it continue wouldn't be illegal under European Law. One British official said privately that if no agreement is reached, EU rules would compel the Irish government to introduce the hard border it does not want. Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Stephen Pound, said an ID card system would have to be introduced to manage immigration after Brexit. \"The idea of having a CGI, virtual reality border is nonsense, it's just a pipe dream but the second thing is it's about goods, it's not about people,\" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had discussed the issue at length with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier during a meeting in Brussels, in which he said there must be no hard border. \"I hope there can now be negotiations to make sure there is a continuation of absolute free movement between the Republic and Northern Ireland,\" he said. Critics argue the re-introduction of the hard border would severely damage the Northern Ireland peace process and have a negative economic impact. A European Commission spokeswoman said: \"We must discuss how to maintain the Common Travel Area and protect, in all of its dimensions, the Good Friday Agreement. \"It is essential that we have a political discussion on this before looking at technical solutions.\" Sea border dismissed The position paper forms part of the government's negotiations with the European Union, ahead of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. As revealed on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis wants a limited transition period to implement any new customs arrangements, including considerations relating to the \"unique circumstances\" of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both the UK and Irish governments have repeatedly stated their opposition to a hard border, but the situation is complicated as the UK intends to leave the EU's customs union. The position paper sets out two \"broad approaches\" to future customs arrangements that the UK hopes will help to prevent physical customs posts along the Irish border. The suggestions are a \"new customs partnership\" or a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\". The partnership model would \"align\" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in \"no customs border at all between the UK and Ireland,\" the paper claims. The paper suggests the second, \"highly-streamlined\" arrangement could include: The paper also dismisses the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea, saying it would be economically and constitutionally unviable. It recognises that all this needs to be negotiated with the EU, in the hope that the border between the EU and the UK will be as \"seamless\" as possible. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not accept that the EU would be unwilling to facilitate the government's proposals. \"If you look at what [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier has said... there is a recognition that there will need to be specific arrangements in relation to customs and other elements in terms of creating that frictionless border,\" he said. \"There is a shared objective that we have, that the EU has and the Irish government has, in finding that solution.\" UK-Irish trade in numbers The Ulster Unionist Party welcomed the government's position paper, while Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said it was a \"constructive step\". \"It is clear the government has listened to voices in Belfast, Dublin, Brussels and London about how the United Kingdom's only EU land border could be managed after we exit the EU,\" said Mrs Foster, NI's former first minister. However, Sinn Féin northern leader Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was \"a fleeting concern for the British government, we are collateral damage\". \"What we need to see is the Irish government acting in the national interest and defending the rights of those people here in the north that voted to stay with the European Union,\" she said. Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said the government seemed to be \"effectively playing for more time\". What is the customs union? Countries in the customs union do not impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-40941393", "title": "UK Brexit position paper opposes Irish border posts"}}

The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden \"was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice\". 'Scapegoat' He added: \"Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction.\" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this \"will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed\". A spokesman for the National Archives said it did not want to provide a comment. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it had not yet received Mr Robertson's submission."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26341122", "title": "Papers about Profumo scandal man 'should be public'"}}

She earned $15.5m (£12.6m) more than she did in 2018, thanks largely to the success of Avengers: Endgame. Modern family actor Sofia Vergara is the only other woman to break into the overall top 10. Earlier this week, Dwayne Johnson was announced as the highest-paid actor of the last 12 months, making $89.4m (£73.6m) according to the latest annual rankings from the financial experts. Notably all of the top 10 actresses earned above $20m (£16.3) this year, compared with last year when only the top two - Johansson and Angelina Jolie made that amount. Johansson is set to reprise her title role in the Avengers spin-off Black Widow next year. Meanwhile, Jolie - who earned $28m (£22.8) in 2018 - drops out of this year's top 10 due to increased earnings for several of the highest earners in the top 10. She is currently acting in and producing two forthcoming films - Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and The One and Only Ivan. Other names to drop out of the top 10 this year include Mila Kunis, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Melissa McCarthy and Gal Gadot. Unlike the male actors list, there's a notable lack of diversity among this year's highest earning women. Vergara is Colombian-American, but there are no black actresses in the top 10. Forbes list of the world's best-paid female actors 2019 The list of top earning male actors was released on Wednesday. Dwayne Johnson - aka The Rock - climbed from his number two placing last year - despite his earnings actually being less than the $119m (£98.1m) he made in 2018. Last year's number one actor George Clooney has dropped out of the top 10. That's because his high earnings on 2018's list were down to the sale of his tequila company, in a deal worth $1bn (£753m). The lists include celebrities' overall earnings, including brand endorsements and don't solely consist of payments for acting. Johnson's endorsements include sportswear firm Under Armour. In the last year, he has starred in the Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, Skyscraper and has produced films like Fighting with My Family and Shazam!. Later this year, he will star in Jumanji: The Next Level alongside Kevin Hart and Jack Black. Elsewhere in this year's top 10, Chris Hemsworth has climbed to second place with earnings of $76.4m (£62.9m) Bradley Cooper has re-entered the top 10 for the first time since 2015 thanks in large part to directing, co-writing, co-producing and starring in the Oscar-winning A Star Is Born. He is the sixth highest earner at $57m (£46.9m) Having only appeared in one major film in the last year (Aladdin), Will Smith is down slightly this year, with his earnings of $35m (£28.8m) placing him 10th.

But the quartet face stiff competition from the likes of Jorja Smith, Lily Allen and Florence + The Machine. Other nominees include Wolf Alice, Noel Gallagher and jazz act Sons of Kemet. Last year's winner, Sampha, also features on the soulful Everything Is Recorded, a collaborative album put together by the head of XL Records, Richard Russell - aka \"the man who signed Adele\". The Arctics, Gallagher and Florence are 4-1 favourites at bookmakers William Hill, with Wolf Alice, Smith and Allen given odds of 6-1. Several of the shortlisted albums are overtly political. Both Nadine Shah's Holiday Destination and Everything Everything's A Fever Dream address the rise in nationalism and xenophobia, coupled with a decline in empathy. London MC Novelist, meanwhile, delivers a strong anti-violence message on his self-produced debut album, Novelist Guy; and Sons Of Kemet's Your Queen Is A Reptile celebrates powerful black women who've been overlooked by history. \"It was really important to document the times we're living in,\" Shah told the BBC. \"As a Muslim woman [living during] a rise in Islamophobia, I'm scared. I'm genuinely scared. So I needed to speak about that.\" Other nominees turn their attention inwards, with Florence + The Machine displaying a new level of vulnerability on High As Hope; and Jorja Smith chronicling the bumpy road to adulthood on her streetwise debut Lost & Found. Pop star Lily Allen receives her first ever nomination for her fourth album, No Shame, an emotional depiction of her marital breakdown and struggles with self-worth. \"Making this record was really tough and it was a slog,\" she told the BBC. \"I felt very disconnected from myself as I was making it. I was trying to find me in and amongst it all. The fact it's connected to other people, it just feels really great.\" The full shortlist for the 2018 prize is: The 2018 shortlist was drawn up by a panel of judges including musicians Marcus Mumford, Jamie Cullum and Ella Eyre, alongside broadcasters Clara Amfo and Mistajam, and a handful of music critics and journalists. They said the nominees held a \"shared belief in the importance of music for navigating life's challenges - whether personal or political, falling in or out of love, growing up or looking back, angry or ecstatic.\" Although the award has a reputation for rewarding up-and-coming acts, there are only three debut albums on this year's list, alongside two number one records and five former nominees. Radio 1's Huw Stephens welcomed the inclusion of artists on their third, fourth or (in Noel Gallagher's case) 10th albums. \"Hopefully it says that we're not as flash-in-the-pan as we have been in the past and that artists have time to build and to grow.\" \"Artists like Arctic Monkeys and Florence + The Machine are being allowed time to develop. They don't always have to go to number one and sell out stadiums and headline Glastonbury. They can just work at their craft for years.\" Multiple nominations Arctic Monkeys, who won the prize for their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, are now the second most-nominated act in the Mercury's 26-year history. Only Radiohead have more nominations, with five, although they've never taken home the trophy. PJ Harvey also has four nominations - and is the only artist to win the award twice, for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea in 2001 and Let England Shake in 2011.

Chloe is 28, a mum of three, and she gave birth to her first surrogate child in August 2017. She's been talking to Newsbeat about why she decided to become a surrogate after having her three children. \"When my daughter was born, it was the most amazing experience,\" she said. \"I instantly fell in love with this little baby and it broke my heart to think there are parents out there who will never have this.\" Chloe has a five-year-old and three-year-old twins. After the birth of their twins, she and her husband decided together that they wanted to help other families. Chloe joined Surrogacy UK, an organisation which supports surrogates and couples who are unable to have children, who they refer to as \"intended parents\". She was introduced to a couple and describes getting to know them as \"almost like dating.\" \"You offer to exclusively get to know them,\" she says. \"We then spent just over four months getting to know each other. We did days out, takeaways in. Normal things you do with friends. \"We built up a relationship and we had faith and trust in each other so we started the IVF process. \"They used the biological mum's egg, the biological father's sperm - I was just the oven at the end. I did the cooking.\" Chloe says her experience of surrogate pregnancy was very different to when she was expecting her own children. \"I was excited to be a mum and to welcome my babies into the world,\" she says. \"This time, I'd liken it to looking after someone else's child. \"I very much view it as a baby to give back, I don't view it as mine to give up.\" And Chloe found it easier to explain the situation to her children than she did some adults. \"I said to my children the intended mother's tummy is broken and doesn't work properly so she can't have her babies so mummy is going to grow their baby and when it's all grown and born, we're going to give it back,\" she said. \"Adults on the whole tend to be a bit nosier, know biology a little bit better so they tend to ask a few more questions.\" In the UK, it is illegal for surrogates to get paid for a baby, but during the pregnancy the intended parents will pay for the mum's essentials. And this comes in handy when pregnancy cravings strike. \"My expenses are covered, so things like fuel, clothing and all the extras that come with pregnancy, all the strange food cravings, all the late night trips to McDonalds for instance,\" says Chloe. \"I had a real hankering for those milkshakes.\" When Chloe gave birth, the intended parents had a room in the same hospital so the child could be a part of their family immediately. She says many adults struggle to understand why she would be a surrogate, but less than six months after giving birth, Chloe is ready to do it all over again. \"I am in that 'get to know' period with another couple,\" she says. \"I do feel like I've been pregnant forever but to be honest I adore pregnancy. I love being pregnant and I don't suffer like some people do. \"I honestly feel like I breeze it and my husband is willing to put up with me hormonal again.\" \"It seems like a good time to do it again while I'm young and then I can say I've done my piece.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here"}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-42729308", "title": "A surrogate mum's story: 'I was just the oven at the end'"}}

Small island states believe keeping temperatures below 1.5C this century is critical to their survival. A key report in October said this was possible. But huge emissions cuts would be needed in the short term. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on 1.5C was commissioned by the UN back in 2015. But when it was presented to climate negotiators in December in Poland, four countries including the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait refused to \"welcome\" it. The simmering battle over the report has re-emerged here at this meeting in Bonn. There has been a serious battle over a text that would include reference to the scientists' conclusion that carbon emissions would have to be reduced by 45% by 2030. Saudi Arabia has been at the fore in wanting to include text that underlined the uncertainties in the report. For the group of around 40 small island states, this has proved inflammatory. \"The report came out in in October of 2018 and now we see this move at the negotiations to try and have it almost erased from existence, which is impossible to do,\" Lois Young, the ambassador from Belize, who is chairing the group, told the BBC. \"There's this move to pretend as though it's not there, to not to refer to it in documents. And it's been ongoing since we got here.\" The Saudis have gained some support in their arguments from an unlikely alliance of countries, including the US, Australia and Iran. \"The countries that are trying to downplay the importance of the document, erase it from the records, not all of them are showing their faces,\" said Ambassador Young. \"It's unreal, it's as though they're resigning our Aosis states to collateral damage, I mean, it's like we have no importance doesn't matter.\" Other observers here believe that the IPCC report has been a critical document in helping raise public awareness of the threat posed by climate change. \"The report has had a transformational effect, not just with the UK now passing a net zero law, but with public opinion around the world,\" said Alden Meyer, from the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"But there is a fault line between a handful of countries, most of them major oil producers on the significance and status of the report. But they can't put the stopper back in the bottle and pretend the report doesn't exist.\" Efforts at finding a compromise are ongoing here in Bonn, with some delegates believing that both the goals for 2030 and the Saudi questions about uncertainty can be accommodated. These talks are due to finish later today but if an agreed text can't be found, the increasingly rancorous debate may spill into the open at the final meeting this afternoon.

The firm says information posted within the service is kept \"secure, confidential and completely separate\" from personal Facebook profiles. The move poses a challenge to LinkedIn. The work-focused social network recently announced its own plan to release a new app to help co-workers share information. Facebook's move also threatens other established collaboration tools targeted at businesses including Yammer - which Microsoft bought for $1.2bn (£788m) in 2012 - Jive and MangoApps. Email overload Facebook already has about 1.4 billion people using its platform at least once a month, but it is currently blocked in some workplaces. The Menlo Park, California-based firm suggested one advantage it had over rival work communication tools was that people were already familiar with the way it worked, meaning firms could save on training costs. Many companies are keen to adopt such software because of complaints that a deluge of messages has made email a poor tool to keep in touch with. \"Facebook at Work is a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using Facebook tools - many that they're likely already using such as News Feed, Groups, messages and events,\" the social network said in a statement. \"The information shared among employees is only accessible to people in the company.\" A spokeswoman added: \"Internally at Facebook we've been using our product for years, and we're now looking forward to the feedback from our pilot partners to create the best possible experience.\" One industry watcher said the move was no surprise. \"If you look how popular things like Yammer have already been, that shows that there is definitely an appetite for a business skew of Facebook itself,\" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group Europe. \"Yammer already has a lot of the look, feel and functionality of Facebook, so it is a logical thing for Facebook to follow Yammer into the marketplace.\" Advert-free For now, the Facebook at Work app is free-to-use, but limited to an unnamed group of companies that will trial its use. At this stage the work version will not feature adverts, nor will it gather data about its users that could be sold on to third parties. \"Businesses would be concerned if it became ad-supported with information shared for context-driven marketing posts - that would be a no-no for a lot of companies on data protection grounds,\" commented Mr Green. \"Companies would probably be happier paying a subscription fee - as is the case with Yammer - and having an ad-free closed environment that they can keep total data control over.\" Facebook responded: \"It's too early discuss future plans around ads or monetisation.\""}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30819036", "title": "Facebook at Work app aims for role in the office"}}

It rained for just 30 minutes. \"After the rain, there was a silence followed by terrible thunder and lightning,\" says 63-year-old resident Cristina Inga. Her house was destroyed first by flooding, and then tonnes of rocks tumbled down from the mountain. \"We survived by escaping through the roof,\" she recalls. \"All the neighbours did the same; we all helped each other.\" When the landslide was over, their street was covered in mud and boulders over two metres (6ft 5 inches) high. The street they lived on ran along a wash, a natural watercourse which floods when it rains heavily in the Andes. It is by no means a place to build homes, but the people who live here are poor. 'No choice' \"I was born here, my parents settled on this land because we had no money\" Ms Inga explains. Her house had been destroyed three times before 23 March. She currently lives in a wooden shack but is proud to be the legal owner of the plot of land it is build on. As for the risks, she says: \"We don't move because we have nowhere else to go.\" What happened in Moyopampa earlier this year is seen by many as a sign of things to come. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the region may be facing the worst El Nino weather phenomenon in over 60 years between now and March. At risk The Peruvian government has already declared a state of emergency in more than half of the country's regions. Peru, along with Ecuador, are the two countries most directly affected by El Nino. In fact, it was Peruvian fishermen who named El Nino (The Child) in a reference to Baby Jesus because it used to arrive around Christmas time. But for the people of Moyopampa, El Nino's arrival is not something they look forward to. It is one of 107 places in Peru which the country's Civil Defence Institute (Indeci) has declared \"vulnerable\". Three million people live in these vulnerable areas and are at risk of losing everything to heavy rains, mudslides and flash floods. The government has set aside three billion Peruvian soles ($1bn; £0.65bn) to respond to the fall-out from El Nino and to support all sectors of the economy threatened by it. 'In God we trust' Previous El Ninos destroyed key roads and bridges leaving communities isolated and often desperate for help. So the ministry of transport is sending more than 1,000 portable bridges to different locations along Peru's coast. So far, most of the government's efforts have been focused on cleaning the beds of coastal rivers, building floodwalls in vulnerable locations and making sure there is enough equipment to help in case of floods, mudslides or any other disasters. On the day I visited the site of the Moyopampa landslide, local authority workers were removing debris which had been littering the street since March. Others were building floodwalls which residents hope will be strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. Ms Inga says she will only move if the government offers her family proper housing. In the meantime, she puts her faith in God. \"I am scared. We are scared. But in God I trust and he always has the last word,\" she says with conviction. But then, as if having second thoughts, she looks up at the sky and adds: \"But down here we should be the first ones to protect ourselves\"."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-34504269", "title": "Peru prepares for El Nino"}}

Mr Magag, 28, of Somali origin, was last seen in north London. He is subject to a TPim control measure, which controversially replaced Labour control orders a year ago. TPims - or Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security and who cannot be deported. Those subject to such orders face restrictions, such as where they stay, who they contact, and where they travel, but differ from control orders in that suspects cannot be forced to relocate to more isolated parts of the UK. During her urgent Commons question, Labour's Yvette Cooper - the shadow home secretary - asked Mrs May whether in \"ditching\" relocation she had \"personally made it easier\" for terror suspects to abscond. Black cab She said: \"Magag is still missing after 13 days. Clearly the home secretary has no idea where he is. \"You must not ignore the evidence on relocations now. Isn't it time you took some responsibility and sorted this mess out?\" Ms Cooper also asked whether the home secretary could confirm whether Mr Magag had escaped his surveillance team by simply getting into a black cab in London's Triton Street. The home secretary refused to confirm this. Mrs May said that under Labour's control orders, seven terror suspects had absconded and only one of them had been found. She insisted the disappearance of Mr Magag did not pose a terror threat, saying: \"The government does not believe Magag's disappearance is linked to any current terrorism planning in the UK. \"Nevertheless, we are of course taking this matter very seriously. The police are doing everything in their power to apprehend Magag as quickly as possible.\" Mr Magag was reported as missing after he failed to report to his overnight residence on 26 December.

{"id": "business-39841164", "label": "With Emmanuel Macron's French election win, the prospect of France leaving the European Union - as proposed by his run-off opponent Marine Le Pen - has been all but eliminated.", "prompts": [{"text": "By Simon AtkinsonBBC Business Reporter But many analysts are already saying that if Mr Macron fails to deliver on economic promises over the next five years, then the challenge from the National Front could be even stiffer come the 2022 election. As a former economy minister to outgoing president Francois Hollande, his economic credentials formed a big part of his campaign. So what are some of his key economic policies? Reforming the eurozone The election result briefly sent the euro to a six-month high against the dollar, as markets reacted to the victory by the pro-EU candidate. Ms Le Pen had campaigned for France to leave the euro and proposed a referendum in which French voters would have an opportunity to vote to leave the EU. Mr Macron wants France to stay in the eurozone, but reform it. In his manifesto, he wanted a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister too. He also will ask Berlin to invest and spend more to help Germany's domestic economy, which it is hoped will help French exporters and manufacturers in other European countries. But all of this can only happen with Germany's backing. There'll be no decisions until after Germany's elections later this year, so for now he can only focus on domestic policy. Help business While Francois Hollande initially tried to please the socialist elements of his party by being tough on companies, Mr Macron as economy minister oversaw a change in direction over the past three years, heralding a more pro-business approach. That included about 40bn euros ($44bn; £33.9bn) in tax breaks to try to invigorate the economy, a benefit Mr Macron plans to make permanent. He also says corporation tax will gradually reduce from 33% to 25%. And a new wealth tax, aimed at the rich, will not apply to financial investments. Tackle unemployment The unemployment rate in France is 10.1%. About three million people who want to work and are looking for a job don't have one. While not the worst figures in Europe, it is above average for the region and far worse than, for example, the Netherlands, where it is just above 5%, and Germany, where it is below 4%. The figure for the UK is below 5%. Youth unemployment is particularly bad, with about one in four under-25s out of work. Mr Macron has said he hopes to get unemployment down by thinning some of the labour laws, with an aim of making it less onerous on employers to take on new staff. The International Monetary Fund estimates that it will be hard to get French unemployment down much below 8.5% without major reform. But one thing in the President-elect's favour is that the strongest union in the private sector is now the moderate CFDT, which now has more clout than the more militant CGT. Mr Macron has no plans to scrap France's controversial 35-hour working week - a rule which doesn't ban long hours, but is a threshold which triggers overtime payment. Instead he has said he'll allow firms to negotiate deals with their staff on hours and pay. And perhaps another sign of hope. The economy has been creating jobs at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Read more: Budget targets The European Union requires members to make sure their budget deficit (essentially the difference between what it brings in through revenues e.g. tax and what it spends) is no more than 3% of gross domestic product. France has missed this target - at times dramatically - in recent years as the Hollande government resisted pressure to bring in swingeing austerity measures. Mr Macron says that as economy minister he was working towards hitting that target, and estimates it'll happen this year. Slim down the state France has one of the largest public sectors in the world. Public spending last year was 56.5% of GDP. And with plans to reduce corporation tax, cutting that spending bill becomes more urgent. Mr Macron believes he can save 60bn euros over five years. This is not hugely radical, for example election rival Francois Fillon had proposed 100bn euros of spending cuts. One concrete measure we know about is plans to cut about 120,000 government jobs by not replacing civil servants when they retire. However, he also wants to make unemployment benefits available to groups currently not eligible, including the self-employed, entrepreneurs and farmers. And while other European countries look to force people to work longer before being entitled to state pensions, France's official retirement age of 62 will be unchanged. The president-elect does, however, have plans to overhaul the system to make pension payouts more closely tied to what individuals pay in."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39841164", "title": "Macronomy: What are Emmanuel Macron's economic plans?"}}

In his first public comments on the allegations, Mr Cuomo said he felt \"embarrassed\" that his actions made the women feel uncomfortable at work. Mr Cuomo asked the public to wait for the \"facts\" before drawing conclusions. The New York attorney general has opened an investigation into the allegations and will file a report on the findings. The governor said he would not resign, despite calls from within his own party for him to step down. What is Cuomo accused of? A former top-level aide to Mr Cuomo, Lindsey Boylan, claimed the governor touched her without consent and frequently made inappropriate comments about her appearance. In an essay published last month, Ms Boylan accused Mr Cuomo of kissing her on the lips and asking her to play strip poker while on his private jet. A second former aide, Charlotte Bennett, told the New York Times that the governor peppered her with personal questions that were clear overtures to a sexual relationship. \"I understood the governor wanted to sleep with me,\" she said. In a statement following Mr Cuomo's press conference, Ms Bennett's lawyer described the governor's statement as \"full of falsehoods and inaccurate information\". Debra Katz disputed Mr Cuomo's claim that he was unaware he had made any of the women uncomfortable, saying Ms Bennett reported the \"sexually harassing behaviour immediately\" to the governor's chief of staff and chief counsel. \"We are confident that they made him aware of her complaint\", Ms Katz said. A third woman, photographer Anna Ruch, said the politician touched her face and asked to kiss her at a wedding. The exchange was captured on camera. A #MeToo moment for Democrats Analysis - Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York When asked what assurances Mr Cuomo could give that there weren't more women who would lodge complaints, he didn't really answer directly, instead repeating that he never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable. But that is a question probably weighing heavily on Democrats who, having taken a strict view of these kinds of allegations in the past, are now facing their own #metoo test in relation to one of the biggest stars in the party. Mr Cuomo had been praised and admired globally for his response to the pandemic and his daily informative briefings. Now he's being cast in a different light and many are questioning his authenticity. Not only is he facing an investigation into sexual harassment claims by the NY Attorney General's office, but also a federal investigation into how he handled data on nursing home deaths, undercounting the true toll. Now that his Covid response doesn't look so sterling, and more women are coming forward, the political future of this three-term governor in the Democratic party may be in peril. What did Mr Cuomo say in his apology? Mr Cuomo has been widely criticised for not yet addressing the allegations publicly. After calls for his resignation intensified earlier this week, he used the end of Wednesday's coronavirus press conference to address them. He said that hugging and kissing people was his \"customary way of greeting\" people, something he learned from his father, former New York governor Mario Cuomo. But he acknowledged times had changed and he had \"learned an important lesson\". \"It doesn't matter my intent. If the women were offended by it then it was wrong. If they were hurt by it, I apologise.\" \"I fully support a woman's right to come forward. And I think it should be encouraged in every way,\" Mr Cuomo continued. But \"wait for the facts before you form an opinion\", he urged. What other political problems does the governor face? The mounting scrutiny on the governor follows Mr Cuomo's admission that he made a \"mistake\" in withholding data about Covid-19 nursing home deaths in the state.

Really? The memorandum only makes clear what the birds have been singing from the rooftops for a long time,\" he writes. He adds that top civil servants should have a \"firm word\" to combat Mrs May's \"fatal habit of trying to sort everything out herself without any sense of priority\". The French business paper Les Echos agrees that Mrs May's \"refusal to delegate\" is as big a problem as alleged cabinet divisions, making it \"difficult to grapple with the titanic task of Brexit\". Enrico Franceschini of Italy's La Repubblica, thinks \"Brexit will collide with a wall built by the government\", while the economics editor of Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Marc Beise, complains that Britain appears \"completely unprepared\", and must \"either move ahead quickly with Brexit or reconsider its position\". 'Opening a door' Die Welt's business correspondent Nikolaus Doll is not alone in seeing in recent remarks by German Chancellor Angela Merkel signs she is looking for compromise on freedom of labour movement. While affirming her commitment to the principle in a speech on Tuesday, she added that there should be a debate about the speed with which migrants can claim benefits - a matter that \"not just the British criticise\", according to Doll. Les Echos agrees that Mrs Merkel \"opened a door\" over movement of labour, in an \"overture to Britain\". In Poland meanwhile, Tomasz Bielecki, Brussels correspondent of Gazeta Wyborcza, reports that Polish diplomats are worried about the \"hole\" Britain's departure could leave in the EU budget, of which Poland is the \"major beneficiary\". \"This is crucial for us,\" he writes, as it will require \"renegotiations that are less and less appealing to many countries, including those appalled at our attitude towards refugees\". 'Wooing Trump' Commentators are intrigued by Theresa May's policy towards Donald Trump, with most seeing a possible transatlantic alliance that may not be to the EU's benefit. The London correspondent of France's Le Monde, Philippe Bernard, thinks Theresa May may have a point in \"counting on Donald Trump to help her with Brexit\", and that London understandably sees a \"parallel between Brexit and Mr Trump's surprise victory\". Alessandra Rizzo of Italy's La Stampa also thinks Mrs May's \"dream\" of Britain becoming a world trade leader in concert with \"old allies\" is bound to try to enlist Mr Trump. Carlos Fresneda of Spain's El Mundo thinks Mrs May \"wasted no time\" in echoing Mr Trump's populist attacks on globalisation and large corporations in a recent speech to business leaders. Berlin's left-wing Tageszeitung complains that there appears to be no will in the EU to \"put Britain in its place\" and stop it \"undermining EU attempts to present a united front against Donald Trump\". \"The EU is not opposing Trump. Rather he and his friends in London are steering us,\" it says . 'Worst time for City' Eric Albert, writing from London for Le Monde, is not so sure. He says London fears Mr Trump might deregulate US financial markets at the \"worst possible time for a City already plagued by Brexit\", with many institutions preparing to move some activities to elsewhere in the EU or Wall Street. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung highlights the German Finance Ministry's statement about the growing number of London companies' inquiries about how to move to Frankfurt, adding that local politicians there are actively courting such interest. But a commentary by the paper's business reporter, Tim Kanning, considers Frankfurt's efforts lacklustre, adding that while banks may be \"sitting on packed bags\", their destination may not be Germany.

After the meeting at Gwydyr House, London, she added: \"In a tough but productive meeting, I have received a commitment from the IPS that a new customer-facing office will be opened in Newport, safeguarding up to 45 jobs and serving up to 47,000 people a year.\" She said she also received assurances that the agency would do all it could to avoid the prospect of compulsory redundancies in the event of the closure of the Newport office. \"It means people in Wales will continue to have access to a passport office in Newport and receive the same standard of service they do now, including emergency same day processing,\" she said. \"This is exactly in line with the service available in Scotland.\" She added that management would be keeping her fully briefed and updated throughout the 90-day period of consultation, which starts next week.

{"id": "world-latin-america-24014501", "label": "It often comes as a surprise to foreigners visiting Chile to discover that Gen Augusto Pinochet still has supporters here.", "prompts": [{"text": "By Gideon LongBBC News, Santiago Outside Chile, the general is almost universally vilified - remembered as a ruthless dictator whose military regime killed more than 3,000 political opponents, tortured many more and drove thousands into exile. But inside the country, views tend to be more nuanced. As the country marks the 40th anniversary of the military coup that brought him to power, attitudes towards Gen Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and the Socialist government of Salvador Allende that preceded it remain complex and subject to intense debate. While most Chileans abhor the human rights abuses committed under his rule, Gen Pinochet still has a small but ardent group of right-wing supporters who regard him as a hero. They say that by ousting Mr Allende on 11 September 1973, the military prevented Chile from sliding into civil war and saved the country from becoming \"another Cuba\" - a communist state. \"The armed forces saved me,\" right-wing congressman Ivan Moreira told Chilean state television this month. \"They saved me from living under a regime, a Marxist dictatorship. Pinochet saved the lives of an entire generation.\" When Gen Pinochet died in 2006, about 60,000 people turned up to file past his coffin and pay their respects. Some were in tears. Others clutched bronze busts and photographs of the general. To this day, there is a museum in Santiago honouring his memory. It contains his military uniforms, his desk, his medals and his extensive collection of toy soldiers from the different regiments of the Chilean army. Mr Moreira says the Pinochet regime has had a bad press. \"How long are we going to carry on accepting that the history of Chile is written by the pen of the left?\" he asked. Mixed views \"I'm a child of the dictatorship,\" said Karen, a Chilean I met recently in Santiago. \"I grew up with both sides of the story. My godmother is a communist but my mother is pro-Pinochet. They are best friends but they never talk about politics. Never. \"I don't believe the dictatorship was that bad,\" Karen told me. \"It was a safer time on the streets for normal people. Now you go to the outskirts of Santiago and there are lots of drugs. There weren't back then. \"Some young people who didn't live through the dictatorship think that everything about it was bad. People of my age, who experienced it, can remember the good and the bad.\" A survey published by pollster CERC on the eve of the 40th anniversary commemorations gives some idea of where Chileans stand on these issues. While three-quarters of those polled said Gen Pinochet was a dictator, 9% said he would go down as one of the greatest leaders in Chilean history. According to the poll, 55% of Chileans regarded the 17 years of the dictatorship as either bad or very bad, while 9% said they were good or very good. More than a third of those polled either had no opinion or regarded the dictatorship years as a mixture of good and bad. Another poll, published in the country's leading newspaper El Mercurio on Sunday, asked Chileans if the state had done enough to compensate victims of the dictatorship for the atrocities they suffered. While 30% said yes, 36% said no. The rest were undecided. Nearly half of those polled (46%) said the state should find new ways of compensating relatives of the disappeared - victims of the dictatorship whose corpses were often dumped at sea or buried in unmarked graves. But over a quarter (27%) disagreed. Ideological split Right-wing historians in Chile use two basic arguments to defend the legacy of the Pinochet regime. Firstly, they say the coup has to be understood in the context of the time - that by 1973 Chile was a deeply polarised country on the brink of civil war and economic collapse. Secondly, they say that the free market reforms implemented by the military government in the 1970s and 1980s laid the foundations for the country's later economic prosperity. It is true that by 1973, Chile was in a sorry state. Mr Allende had been in power for three years and the country was increasingly split along ideological lines. A series of strikes by truck drivers and copper miners had weakened the economy. Right-wing paramilitary groups were sabotaging power lines and transport routes. Basic provisions like bread and flour were scarce. \"As early as December 1971, women took to the streets in what became known as 'the march of the empty saucepans' because of the problems they had getting hold of basic goods,\" says Adolfo Ibanez, a historian and columnist for El Mercurio. \"And in 1972 and 1973 the situation got worse.\" Evelyn Matthei, a right-wing candidate in forthcoming presidential elections, said this month that by September 1973, \"the immense majority\" of Chileans wanted to see the back of the Allende administration. Economic success The reasons for this animosity and for the economic turmoil of the time are still hotly debated. The right says Mr Allende's government was incompetent. The left says Chile's powerful and conservative business lobby, backed by covert funding from the United States, undermined the government. It was against this backdrop that the coup took place. After assuming power, the military government opened up the economy to the free market. Foreign mining companies, the assets of which had been expropriated under Mr Allende, were invited back into the country. State-owned companies were sold off. The education and pension systems were privatised. The right says these reforms helped Chile become what it is now: one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America. Just how much of Chile's prosperity is down to the policies of the Pinochet regime, and how much is to do with the policies of later centre-left governments and the country's vast mineral wealth, is still a matter of debate. Human rights This week's 40th anniversary has rekindled the debate in Chile over the rights and wrongs of the coup, the shortfalls of the Allende government and the legacy of military rule. Ultimately, though, for the outside world, the Pinochet regime is likely to be judged on its human rights record rather than its economic achievements. According to official figures, 40,018 people were victims of human rights abuses under the dictatorship and 3,065 were killed or disappeared. That remains by far the biggest stain on the Pinochet legacy."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24014501", "title": "Chile still split over Gen Augusto Pinochet legacy"}}

And Downton Abbey actress Penelope Wilton is made a dame for services to drama. There are CBEs for England cricket captain Alastair Cook, former footballer Alan Shearer and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter, and OBEs for TV presenters Ant and Dec and actor Brian Blessed. Twelve famous faces in Birthday Honours In pictures: Entertainment figures on list Dame Vera Lynn 'surprised' by accolade The lists in full 'Most diverse' The UK's first official astronaut, Maj Peake is due to return to Earth this month after a six-month mission and said he was \"honoured to receive the first appointment to the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George for extraordinary service beyond our planet\". The honour is usually given for \"serving the UK abroad\". Stewart, 71 - now officially Sir Roderick - said: \"I've led a wonderful life and have had a tremendous career thanks to the generous support of the great British public. This monumental honour has topped it off and I couldn't ask for anything more.\" Of the 1,149 people recognised on the list, 70% are being honoured for work in their communities, either in a voluntary or paid capacity. The youngest person on the list is 21-year-old apprentice Gary Doyle, who receives a British Empire Medal (BEM) after taking gold at the World Skills event for his \"extraordinary plumbing and heating prowess\". The Cabinet Office said it was the \"most diverse\" since the Order of the British Empire was founded in 1917. Women make up 47% of the total, 8.2% are from a black and minority ethnic background and 5.2% consider themselves to have a disability. However, Vote Leave has accused David Cameron of \"abusing the honours system\" - pointing out 22 prominent supporters of the campaign to remain in the EU are on the list, which goes to the prime minister for approval.

Describing themselves as \"two ordinary lads from the west end of Newcastle\" they added: \"This will definitely be the proudest our mams have ever been.\" Among the others from the world of entertainment is actor and BBC radio presenter Adil Ray, the creator of TV comedy Citizen Khan, who becomes an OBE. 'Bittersweet' There are 13 new dames on the list. They include Louise Casey, who has undertaken high-profile work for successive governments on issues including anti-social behaviour. Her honour comes for services to families and vulnerable people. Last year Dame Louise produced a report into child sex abuse in Rotherham. Youth worker Jayne Senior, who said the report vindicated her efforts to help expose the scandal, is appointed MBE for services to child protection in Rotherham. Her inclusion on the list was \"bittersweet\", she said, because it came in the wake of so many \"ruined and devastated\" young lives. One of the world's leading experts in forensic anthropology, Prof Sue Black from Dundee University, said she was \"more than a little embarrassed\" to receive a damehood for services to her profession. \"However, it is certainly always encouraging for me... to receive recognition because everything we do reflects on the team,\" she said. Rotha Johnston has been made a dame for services to the Northern Ireland economy and her role promoting female entrepreneurship through the Northern Ireland Women's Network.

He later served as MP for Midlothian for 14 years. Sir Alex was a champion of rural affairs during his 17 years at Holyrood, and his knighthood also acknowledges his work in the Scottish parliamentary process and public life in Scotland. 'Very average' The CBE for England cricket captain Cook, who recently became the youngest player to score 10,000 Test runs, is for services to the game, while his teammate Stuart Broad becomes an MBE. Former Newcastle and England footballer Shearer, who is appointed CBE for charitable services to the community in north-east England, joins several other sporting names on the list. These include Chelsea Ladies FC manager Emma Hayes (MBE), rugby referee Nigel Owens (MBE) and Davis Cup tennis players Jamie Murray and Leon Smith (OBEs). Smith, who led Great Britain to a first title Davis Cup title since 1936, said he started out as a \"very average\" tennis player, and described his honour as \"humbling\". Martine Wiltshire, a Team GB sitting volleyball player and Paralympian, who lost both her legs in the London 7/7 bombings, is appointed MBE for services to sport.

{"id": "uk-politics-35107203", "label": "MPs have voted to allow fracking for shale gas 1,200m below national parks and other protected sites.", "prompts": [{"text": "The new regulations - which permit drilling from outside the protected areas - were approved by 298 to 261. Opposition parties and campaigners criticised the lack of a Commons debate - and accused ministers of a U-turn as they previously pledged an outright ban on fracking in national parks. The government said its plans would protect \"our most precious landscapes\". Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom also said there had already been \"enormous debate\" on the subject. Ballot papers MPs overwhelmingly rejected a bid to suspend drilling for shale gas in a Commons vote in January, during which ministers also pledged an \"outright ban\" on fracking in national parks. Labour has said the government's plans, contained in a draft regulation, represent a U-turn on this commitment, and called for stronger safeguards. The proposals, first set out in July, would only allow fracking 1,200m below national parks, Areas of Outstanding National Beauty, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads and World Heritage Sites. The drill rigs would have to be positioned outside the boundaries of the protected areas. Q&A: What is fracking? Sites of Special Scientific Interest, which are designated to protect wildlife or geology, are not mentioned. MPs opposed the passing of the draft regulation when it was read out in the Commons on Tuesday evening. Because this happened after the conclusion of the day's main business, parliamentary rules required the vote to be deferred - until Wednesday. Under this process of so-called deferred divisions, MP voted on the proposal by filling in ballot papers with the result announced later by Deputy Speaker Natascha Engel. Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy accused ministers of using a \"parliamentary backdoor\" to try to approve the \"weak regulations\" without debate. She said: \"Fracking should not go ahead in Britain until stronger safeguards are in place to protect drinking water sources and sensitive parts of our countryside like national parks.\" The political battle over fracking The vote to allow fracking under national parks is the latest stage of the political battle over drilling for shale gas, writes BBC political reporter Tom Moseley. MPs voted in January to continue with fracking, and David Cameron declared last year the UK was going \"all out\" for shale gas - but it remains a controversial issue in the Commons. This is particularly true for MPs - including many Conservatives - facing fracking, and vocal anti-fracking campaigns, in their constituencies. In January the government said there would be an outright ban on fracking in protected areas. But that was under the Tory/Lib Dem coalition, and in July the new Conservative administration unveiled new guidelines allowing drilling at least 1,200m under ground. These were the regulations approved in today's deferred division - sparking accusations of a U-turn from Labour, which wants a moratorium on fracking until \"we can be sure it is safe\". Four Tories voted against the government including London mayoral candidate and environmental campaigner Zac Goldsmith and Sarah Wollaston, whose Totnes seat includes Dartmoor national park. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the government had shown a \"complete lack of regard for protecting some of the most beautiful scenery in the UK and its wildlife\", while Greenpeace criticised the use of what it called an \"arcane parliamentary process\". Rose Dickinson, of Friends of the Earth, said the new rules would put drinking water and national parks \"at risk of fracking\" and represented \"a complete U-turn on earlier promises\". No fracking is currently taking place in the UK, but details of sites where drilling is likely to take place are expected on Wednesday. More than 100 sites, of 10km across, are expected to be granted licences, with most in Northern England. Ms Leadsom said it was \"rubbish\" to say the government had tried to \"sneak in\" the new regulations.

There are big profits to be made from illegal logging and the fraudulent clearing of rainforest for valuable cash crops and these helicopter patrols are often shot at. Trying to locate illegal logging operations in the midst of this dense jungle from the air is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Destroyed on the spot There are probably thousands of small illegal logging camps across the Amazon. Men armed with machetes and chainsaws, cutting down valuable Brazilian hardwoods are the foot soldiers in a highly profitable and dangerous trade. On the ground, the Ibama agents show little sympathy to the loggers. Those that are caught risk arrest, their camps are set alight and their machinery, including expensive tractors and other equipment, are destroyed on the spot. All of this might appear harsh but, says Maria Luisa de Sousa, the Ibama official who has been co-ordinating this month-long operation in northern and eastern Mato Grosso, the fight to save the Amazon is increasingly a fight against organised crime. \"You can compare it to the struggle against drugs trafficking. The crime and the criminals keep on adapting.\" As we wait for our helicopter to be refuelled before heading out on another mission she adds: \"They're getting even more sophisticated, using even bigger tools to deforest, which makes it even more dangerous for us.\". Everything felled We fly on, over virgin jungle, but also over immense fields of soya and corn, cash crops that have earned valuable export profits for Brazil in recent decades and also help to feed the growing population in the south of the country. Some of the most recent deforestation sometimes seems blatant and egregious. Down below we spot two huge tractors - the \"new beasts\" of the jungle. They are involved in one of the most destructive forms of deforestation in the Amazon. In this case, several acres of trees have been felled in a couple of days or weeks. Dragging a huge, steel chain between them, the tractors have felled everything in their path. New monthly figures show that deforestation rates in some parts of Brazil have almost doubled compared to last year. Those statistics also show that increasing amounts of wood are illegally taken from protected indigenous reserves. Threatening gangs Three hours' drive from the town of Aripuana, I spent two days with members of the Cinta Larga tribe. They may wear Western-style clothes and live in wooden shelters, rather than grass huts, but they mainly live in and off the forest. This is a reserve being increasingly invaded by illegal loggers - unscrupulous and sometimes threatening gangs who cut down trees by day and spirit away truckloads of wood by night. \"The loggers come in here for the valuable hardwoods that have already been lost elsewhere,\" says Amadeus. \"That's why the pressure on our land and all the indigenous lands around here is so strong.\" Read more about the concerns of Amazon residents. In some areas, its thought that as much as 80% of the timber felled is done so illegally - from state-owned or indigenous land. Back in Aripuana, there seems to be as many timber mills as there are coffee shops in Rome. It is in the sawmills that illegal or \"dirty\" wood with false certification gets mixed up with the legitimate industry. \"There's no way to tell which timber is legal and which is illegal after the chain is contaminated,\" says Greenpeace researcher Marina Lacorte. \"We're asking international companies and importers to stop buying timber from Brazil because there's no guarantee that official documents can guarantee the legal origin,\" she adds. Managed exploitation Such a move would surely be harsh on those legal timber companies who have nothing to hide about their operations. SM Wood & Laminates only deals in certified timber and in its yard huge, decades-old logs await cutting up for export. More than 50 people work at the plant in a region where 20 million Brazilians now live. Manager Vanderlei Nunes is frank and honest in his view that only by placing a monetary value on the forest, allowing managed exploitation of the Amazon - including indigenous areas - can the rainforest survive. \"I think that people in the south of Brazil and in Europe and the US think the forest is untouchable, but they forget that there are people living and working here,\" says Mr Nunes, who like many of those who now call the Amazon home, initially came here in search of work from other parts of Brazil. \"So until we find a formula for them to live from the forest - get an income from it and give it a value - then the Amazon problem won't be resolved.\" Last week in a highly publicised trip to Washington, Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff expressed her \"deep concern\" for the climate and in a joint press conference with US President Barack Obama, she made numerous pledges about the environment - promising among other things to stop all illegal deforestation. But many environmentalists are sceptical about her ability to deliver on her promises. Under tighter economic constraints her government has repeatedly cut environmental budgets, while the emphasis has often lent towards the right of Brazil to develop and exploit its resources over the need to protect biodiversity. As long as that remains the case and if President Rousseff fails to match the rhetoric in Washington with the appropriate resources, the future of this unique wilderness remains in jeopardy."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-33449810", "title": "Brazil's Amazon wilderness at risk from organised crime"}}

The pro-government paper Izvestiya, however, hails the move as a \"turning point\" in Russian politics. 'Minority interest' \"Putin demonstrates delicacy ahead of the Olympics,\" political analyst Leonid Davydov tells liberal business daily Vedomosti. Talking to the same paper, another pundit, Yevgeny Minchenko says that the decision to set Khodorkovsky free is \"no risk for the authorities\". \"The parliamentary opposition is tamed, and opposition outside parliament does not exist,\" he explains. The same opinion is voiced in popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets. Putin's decision \"will immensely improve the international media backdrop for the Sochi Olympics\", writes Stanislav Belkovsky. He explains that the former oil tycoon has \"ceased to pose a threat to the Russian president and to the regime\", as once released he \"is more likely to focus on repairing the damage done to his health by imprisonment and engage in public works of a non-radical nature\". Mikhail Khodorkovsky's fate \"has always been of interest to a minority of Russian citizens\", argues Lev Gudkov in Kommersant, \"the 25-30%... who are educated follow the news via independent sources and are therefore aware of the political context\". Forced to beg? \"Mikhail Khodorkovsky surrenders for pardon,\" says a headline in Kommersant, the most popular financial daily in the country. The paper quotes sources as saying that recently Khodorkovsky had \"a chat with security officials\" who told him that \"his mother, who has cancer, is getting worse and that a new criminal case will be launched against him very soon\". \"It was that conversation, which took place without lawyers present, that prompted Khodorkovsky to appeal to the president [for clemency],\" says the daily. A similar assumption appears in heavyweight centrist broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta. It cites a \"well-informed expert\" who claims that Khodorkovsky \"was approached by the prison administration, who assured him that were he to write an appeal for pardon, it would be immediately granted\". Pro-government daily Izvestiya sees the decision to release Khodorkovsky as a \"turning point\" in the history of Russia. The paper predicts the moment will have the same significance for the country as the end of the civil wars, known as Fronde, had for France in the 17th Century. \"Our Fronde is over,\" declares the paper's deputy editor Boris Mezhuyev. He argues that the \"symbolic\" end of the confrontation in society was \"marked by the amnesty given to participants in the 2011 and 2012 [anti-government] protests\" and \"most importantly\" by the pardon granted to \"the first and main leader of our local Fronde, businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky\". Other commentators, however, are not so optimistic. \"One should not expect that Putin's decision would have a significant impact on the Russian economy,\" analyst Igor Nikolayev tells financial RBK Daily. \"It's hard to imagine that the PR impact of pardoning Khodorkovsky will heal the wounds inflicted on the economy and society a decade ago. \"Investment won't start coming back, closed down and never-started enterprises won't be reborn, and those who have emigrated won't return,\" says an editorial in another business paper, Vedomosti. The daily argues that \"the system established over the past decade will continue to operate\", although \"the system no longer fears Khodorkovsky himself\", it adds.

Yet coming to terms with racism is tough, even for the well-meaning.", "prompts": [{"text": "By Tara McKelveyDecorah, Iowa Guy Nave, an academic with a Yale PhD, moved to Decorah nearly two decades ago. The Iowa town seemed idyllic. It had stone buildings, a train depot and Victorian homes that looked like gingerbread houses. Then, shortly after starting his job at a local college, he locked himself out of his house. He was rattling a patio door when police showed up. The officer had received a call, and was told \"someone who didn't look like they belonged in the neighbourhood was walking around the house\", Nave recalls. That person was a black man - that person was Nave. There were other incidents. He was pulled over a dozen times for minor violations during his first year living in the town. He focused on work and tried to ignore those incidents. Then, in May 2020, George Floyd died while in police custody and townspeople organised a Black Lives Matter march, the first of its kind. The town was waking up. 'We cannot close off from what's happening' Small towns are slow to change. A point of pride here is that glaciers missed Decorah, located in north-eastern Iowa, some 12,000 years ago, leaving it with rolling hills - a topography that dates back eons. It had been stuck in time culturally, too. Until recently, racism was rarely discussed. Floyd's death affected people here deeply, however, and sparked a movement. \"It changed Decorah, in a way where they cannot close off from what is happening all around,\" says Maria Leitz, an educator. But not everyone reacted in the same way. \"People were really sad about it,\" says Leitz. \"But I was really mad about it.\" As the trial of Derek Chauvin - the former police officer accused in Floyd's death - unfolds, she pays attention, and watches some of the testimony. \"I do hear snippets,\" she says. But she has tried to limit how much she sees: \"It's just so emotional.\" With the trial underway, and as more protests take place in Minneapolis, people here are fighting racism with new energy. Leitz is now part of a committee - Decorah Human Rights Commission - a group that was established in 2006 to investigate housing and other complaints, but which had languished. \"We're sorting out what Decorah can do,\" she says. She and other members of the commission have encouraged business owners to put specially designed, black-and-white \"All Are Welcome\" stickers on windows, promoting an accepting environment. In addition, Leitz helped to organise the town's Black Lives Matter march, and made posters: \"My sign said: 'Change.'\" Not everybody marched but most supported the idea, reflecting a trend of open-mindedness. More than half of the people who live in rural areas said they sympathised with those who protested in the wake of Floyd's death, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. While I was driving through Iowa, the country song, Undivided, played, often: \"Why's it got to be all white or all black?\" Leitz was born in El Salvador, and grew up in a town near Decorah. When she was a child, she says, people called her racial slurs. She left town, lived abroad. One recent afternoon she stood in a field with a friend, also an activist, and looked at the green hills - the landscape that brought her back. One benefit of her activism has been her new friend, Nikki Battle, who works for an insurance adjuster, and has biracial children. Battle nods, saying: \"We fell into a really beautiful friendship.\" 'These issues can't be on the backburner' People here say that their town embodies decency, a place where someone will dig your car out of a ditch if you slide off the road. Marnie Carlson, a school counsellor, describes it as \"a really safe little community\". On a recent morning, she chased her daughters, Marit, four, and Daphne, two-and-a-half, and their Old English sheepdog, Rosie, in a park. Still, she says, small towns can be \"pretty insular\", and the protest march was a milestone. \"We need to say: 'Hey, even though we're largely white, that's why we need to care about this movement,'\" she says. \"Just because don't have a lot of racial diversity, doesn't mean we're going to isolate ourselves from what's going on around us.\" In a town that is 93% white, filled with people of Norwegian heritage, racial injustice has, until now, not been an issue for the majority. \"Most people haven't really met a person of colour,\" says Jeremy Meyer, who handles billing for a logistics monitoring company. \"I think it's something that you just don't think about.\" Then George Floyd was killed, and people watched as he took his last breath. Maren Beard and her husband, Tom, were having coffee in their farmhouse, when she clicked on the video: \"Yeah, I mean, I immediately kind of went into a pretty intense, a very physical response. I started sobbing.\" On a recent morning, her border collie, Noche, chased sheep, and geese flew across a grey-blue sky. Floyd's death changed her, she says: \"I think it was a wakeup call, for sure. These issues can't be on the backburner. They are something we need to think about all the time.\" Still, some complain. A construction worker, asking me not to use his name, says he resents the way that store owners are asked to put the black-and-white \"welcome\" stickers in their windows: \"Now, it's: 'Oh, I won't come to your business because you don't have a Black Lives Matter flag. Stuff like that.\" But, as veterans of the movement know, change takes time, especially in a small town. Guy Nave lives around the corner from his old house, in the neighbourhood where he was once told that he did not belong. The town has a long way to go, but he sees a path, one forged with affection and concern for others. \"There is no way out of the degradation of racism, the pain, the injustice, without love,\" he says. Later, he barbecued jerk chicken in his yard. Funk music played on a loudspeaker, in a neighbourhood that seemed, at least on that evening, welcoming to all."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56726028", "title": "How George Floyd's death changed a small Iowa town"}}

The deputy prime minister said Sir John would like to finish his work \"as soon as possible\". The Cabinet Office said discussions over documents should end \"shortly\". The inquiry was set up in June 2009 and heard from final witnesses in February 2011. It examined the background to the war, the conduct of military operations, post-war planning and the UK's role in post-war security and governance until British troops left in 2009. Those giving evidence included former Prime Minister Tony Blair, his ex-communications chief Alastair Campbell and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. The Independent newspaper suggested that the report - originally expected before the end of 2011 - might not be produced until early next year, potentially making Iraq an issue in the general election. 'Very sensitive' At his monthly press conference, Mr Clegg - who was not an MP in 2003 and whose Liberal Democrat party opposed the war - said: \"Clearly I think everybody would like, after this very long period of time, for the Chilcot inquiry to be published. \"I'm sure Chilcot himself would like to get on with it as quickly as possible because he has been at this now for a long period of time.\" He added: \"I can't comment on exactly the reasons why, given that there was a lot of toing and froing about what is finally produced in published form in the report, exactly what the hold-up now is. \"This involves a lot of people, it involves a lot of legalities and of course deals with a very, very sensitive issue. \"But I really do hope now that everybody involved, including those who know they will be subject to renewed scrutiny within the Chilcot report, that they will now accept that it is just time to get this report published so that the record can be scrutinised in the most objective way possible.\" Mr Clegg also said: \"This was one of the most momentous, in my view one of the most catastrophic decisions in British foreign policy - I would say the most catastrophic decision - since Suez. \"It is quite right that as a country we learn the lessons, we understand the truth and that those who might not like to be subject to further scrutiny subject themselves to the further scrutiny which will be included in the Chilcot report.\" Syria In a statement last November Sir John said that he was waiting for the \"satisfactory completion of discussions between the inquiry and the government on disclosure of material that the inquiry wishes to include in its report or publish alongside it\". A spokesman for Mr Blair said: \"If Nick Clegg is implying Tony Blair is the reason for the delay, that is completely wrong. Tony Blair has as much reason as anyone for wanting the report published. \"Not least because it gives him a chance to defend himself against Nick Clegg's assertion that removing Saddam Hussein from power was 'the most catastrophic decision since Suez,' whilst daily the consequences of inaction over Syria become ever more apparent.\" A spokesman for the Cabinet Office, which co-ordinates the running of government, said: \"The Chilcot inquiry has had full unfettered access to all government papers. \"The Cabinet Office has been in a constructive dialogue with the inquiry team over recent months, with a clear view to meeting their declassification requests. \"This has involved several thousand documents, subject only to ensuring that national security and foreign policy objectives are not compromised as provided for in the protocol agreed at the outset of the inquiry.

Education Minister, Peter Weir, said that a significant number were failing to deliver the best for their pupils. However, no specific proposals for the future of individual schools will be made until early 2017. The draft plan provides a framework for deciding which schools are unsustainable. The document also reveals that almost half of post-primary schools and 40% of primary schools are expected to have budget deficits by 2018-19. The financial position of a school is one of six ways in which it is decided if a school is sustainable or not. The others are quality of educational experience, enrolment trends, strong leadership, accessibility and strong links with the community. Currently, over a third (36%) of primary schools have fewer than 105 pupils, while almost half of post-primary schools have fewer than 500 pupils. Those are the optimal numbers of pupils recommended in the Department of Education's sustainable schools policy. Speaking in the assembly, Mr Weir said: \"We have too many small primary schools with more than two year groups in a single class. \"There are too many schools with too few pupils to generate sufficient funds to deliver the curriculum to an acceptable level. \"It is a real issue particularly in schools with very small sixth forms,\" he added. \"We have schools that are too small to adequately provide for their pupils and ensure they have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. \"The current status quo is not an option.\" Population changes The draft area plan states that the educational needs of pupils must be met \"in the most efficient and effective way possible\". \"This can only be achieved through a network of viable and sustainable schools that are of the right type, the right size, located in the right place and have a focus on raising standards.\" The plan also outlines projected population changes across the 11 council areas in Northern Ireland. For instance, the number of children under 15 years of age in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon council area is set to increase 10% by 2024, the highest increase in Northern Ireland. By contrast, the Ards and North Down council area is projected to have a 2.4% decrease of young people under 15 by 2024.

Mr Pearce said: \"I tried to shop at Sainsbury's this morning and because I am classified as vulnerable, I thought I'd be able to register quite easily. \"I went onto the UK government's web page but found I couldn't sign up because I live in Wales. \"It's ridiculous. How am I meant to get my shopping delivered now? I have always had it delivered but now I'm expected to pick it up. This can't be right.\" Age Cymru said it was \"vital\" for people in Wales to be able to sign up. Its chief executive Victoria Lloyd said: \"Many older people have told us that they have to wait for up to three weeks for a delivery while others were simply thrown out of the registration process. \"Systems must be put in place to enable the supermarkets to verify who exactly needs to be given priority in Wales. \"We have contacted the Welsh Government about the issue and we'll be urging the appropriate authorities in Wales to work with the retail sector to make sure vulnerable people are not worried about how they will feed themselves over the coming weeks.\" John Evans, who lives in Llanharry, Rhondda Cynon Taff, cares for his disabled wife and has family members who are asthmatic. He says he also went on the Sainsbury's website to register as vulnerable but it directed him to the UK government page which asked if he was living in England. \"It's ridiculous and frustrating and I'm not the kind of person who isn't familiar with being online,\" he said. Retired nurse Beverly Harrison-Wood, 63, from Cardigan, Ceredigion, told BBC Wales the earliest delivery slot she has been offered with any of the major supermarkets was mid-April. Mrs Harrison-Wood, who has rheumatoid arthritis, lives with her husband, 69, and her 85-year-old mother, said they had about a week's worth of food left. She said: \"There's no chance at all of getting a delivery... \"Unfortunately we can't [sign up for priority] as it's available to England but not to Wales, which is annoying.\" 'Working hard' She said some small local shops were now doing deliveries: \"They are trying their hardest, but we don't shop there and we don't know what they sell.\" Sainsbury's has said it is doing its \"absolute best\" to make online delivery slots available to vulnerable customers.

But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace. \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January. Morricone's soundtrack will be released by Decca on 18 December."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35042217", "title": "Ennio Morricone denies criticising Quentin Tarantino"}}

She said a cross-party group wants to \"force the government to do the right thing\". The UK government has denied that MPs were led to believe the cut would come into force in April. But former UK sports minister Tracey Crouch resigned claiming her colleagues had delayed the plans. Ms Crouch stood down after Chancellor Philip Hammond said in the Budget the cut in stakes from £100 to £2 would come into force in October 2019. She said pushing back the date was \"unjustifiable\" and it could cost the lives of problem gamblers. Speaking on Monday, Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fixed odds betting terminals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We're going to be tabling a new clause and amendment to the Finance Bill and force the government into doing the right thing.\" The Welsh Labour deputy leader said there was a \"very realistic chance\" that MPs would back bringing in the cut to April 2019 when they discuss the Finance Bill. \"There's a huge feeling in the House that this is the wrong decision and we need to implement it as a matter of urgency.\" She added: \"Iain Duncan Smith [the Conservative MP] and I have become a big tag-team on this. We've not strong-armed, people have very willingly given us their consent.\" Ms Harris' amendment is due to be tabled late on Tuesday. A vote could take place next week - Ms Harris is hoping the government will concede before her amendment is debated on the floor of the House. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government. Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette.

Those who make it to the next stage face numerical and verbal reasoning tests. More than 1,000 candidates are expected to be invited to an assessment centre in December for the final tests. The NCA's deputy director general Phil Gormley said the trainee programme showed it was opening up the agency to \"new people and new ideas\".

I think we're letting down children.\" The BBC has analysed figures from Ofsted, which has data from 146 of the 153 local authorities that provide fostering services in England. As of 31 March 2019 there were 54,870 children in foster care in England - 76% were white, 23% were BAME. The analysis found 99 authorities - 68% of the 146 - had a shortage or undersupply of foster carers from a BAME background. Authorities were deemed to have an undersupply when the gap between the percentage of carers and percentage of foster children who were BAME was bigger than five, and they had at least 15 children in foster care. Until he turned 18 last year, Shaz, a British Muslim of Pakistani heritage from Bradford, had been in care for four years, spending his time in three different care homes. He was never placed with a Muslim foster family and many of his care staff were white. \"It was weird because, being Muslim, I eat halal meat and I go to the mosque and stuff like that, but then when I transitioned into being in care they didn't know what that meant. \"In quite a lot of circumstances they would give me pork and stuff but then I wouldn't eat it and I would explain to them I wasn't going to eat it but then I would get into arguments and it was like 'you can't force feed me'. \"It felt like there was something wrong with me, something wrong with the colour I was.

Mr Hussain said: \"We live in a multi-cultural society and there's a lot more kids from ethnic backgrounds coming into care. \"We get a lot of phone calls from a lot of carers, white carers, and they'll say 'we've got this child in care, how we meet their needs, what do we need to do for Eid or what do we need to do for their diet?'. \"If there were more carers from BAME backgrounds they'd be able to meet these needs.\" Fostering charity Coram BAAF told the BBC that often when a child came into care the priority was to provide them with a safe place and sometimes their other needs were ignored.

Co-chairman Guilherme Leal told the BBC it would remain committed to the firm's principles on ingredients and testing. \"We are much more similar to The Body Shop than L'Oreal,\" Mr Leal said. \"I respect L'Oreal, but they are a huge corporation,\" he added. The Body Shop, founded by the late Dame Anita in 1976, was a pioneer in using natural ingredients for its beauty products. Mr Leal said: \"Natura is a company that was born in the same way of The Body Shop almost at the same time. \"And we have this connection with sustainability, with ingredients from the Amazon, and we need a platform to go abroad.\" Natura started in 1969 and has since grown into one of Latin America's biggest cosmetics groups. Its success is based on a vast network of sales consultants and a culture of using local communities to source ingredients from the Amazon in a sustainable way. The acquisition was announced in June and concluded last week. The deal turns Natura into a global player, buying The Body Shop's 3,200 shops in 66 countries and 18,000 workers. In 2013, it also purchased Australian group Aesop. L'Oreal bought The Body Shop from its original owners back in 2006, when the company was at its height. But recently the brand has seen a drop in sales, with other competitors increasing their market share. 'Protect the Amazon' Mr Leal told the BBC the deal is also a strategy for Natura to reduce its risks, as most of its sales are done in Latin America, where many countries have recently experienced recession, particularly Brazil. By expanding its operations to Europe the group will be less exposed to the problems of the Brazilian economy. The co-chairman of Natura also criticised Brazil for its mismanagement of resources in the Amazon, saying the country is not wisely using its natural wealth. Brazil's President Michel Temer recently issued a decree to open up parts of the forest to mining activities. The decision has been suspended and is under review, after public outcry against the measure. Mr Leal, who ran for vice-president of Brazil in 2010 as part of the Green Party, said the country should reconsider its economic activities in the rainforest. \"I don't think the Amazon is a place to do agriculture. You should use the already devastated areas for that. \"On mining, Brazil needs mining for sure, but you should really have a deep dialogue with society to establish the right rules to use the Amazon for those activities,\" he said."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41231763", "title": "Body Shop owners 'to keep Dame Anita Roddick's legacy alive'"}}

This is the latest in a series of incidents this year at the Kirti monastery, in Aba County - called Ngaba in Tibetan - in Sichuan province. As well as the self-immolations, there has been a stand-off between residents and the security forces, and a row about a group of monks sent for re-education - an incident that even drew comment from the United Nations. China has reacted by tightening security at the monastery, launching a series of criminal prosecutions and criticising the behaviour of some monks. But it still appears to be struggling to assert its authority in at least this one Tibetan area. 'Worrying trend' News of the latest self-immolation came from campaign groups with contacts in the area. The US-based International Campaign for Tibet said the monk had set himself on fire on Monday as he shouted slogans against the Chinese government. China's state-run Xinhua news agency confirmed the incident had taken place, saying the police had immediately extinguished the flames. The monk had only slight burns to his leg, according to Xinhua. Another campaign organisation, Free Tibet, based in London, also reported the incident. \"A growing number of Tibetans clearly feel that this is the only way that they can be heard,\" said Stephanie Brigden, the director of Free Tibet. This is the fifth case of self-immolation in Tibetan areas of western Sichuan province this year, something Ms Brigden described as a \"worrying and absolutely unprecedented\" trend. Thubten Samphel, a spokesman for the Tibetan government-in-exile, said Tibetan Buddhism did not accept violence against other people or oneself. \"Whatever the reason for this, it's a very strong and desperate indication that the people there are totally unhappy,\" he said from the government's base in Dharamsala in India. 'Know nothing' It is not easy, though, to understand even what is going on in and around the Kirti monastery, let alone why it is happening. Kirti has a sister monastery in Dharamsala, and the two sets of monks keep in touch using mobile phones. \"It seems the monastery is under heavy police and military surveillance,\" said Thubten Samphel, adding that reports had come from this informal network between the two monasteries. But, in an indication of just how patchy those links can be, he said the government-in-exile learnt about this latest self-immolation only through international news reports. Telephone calls to the monastery and surrounding town glean little more in the way of information about what is going on in the area. Workers at hotels and businesses on Tuesday told the BBC they knew nothing about the monk who had set fire to himself. A person who answered the phone at the monastery was equally unhelpful. \"I don't know anything about it,\" he said. The Chinese government usually restricts journalists' visits to sensitive Tibetan areas - something the US government has recently complained about - so it is difficult to get on-the-ground information. And officials are almost always reluctant to talk openly about such incidents. \"Police are investigating the man's motives,\" was the curt comment in the Xinhua report about why this latest monk should feel impelled to set himself alight. Prosecutions But the Chinese government has not been passive - it has attempted to counter the discontent being displayed at the Kirti monastery. In August it sentenced three monks to lengthy prison sentences for helping another to kill himself through self-immolation in March. And earlier this year it ordered the \"legal education\" of monks at the monastery, an incident, among others, that resulted in queries from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. It wanted to know what was going on at the Kirti monastery and surrounding area. The Chinese government gave perhaps its fullest justification yet for its actions at the monastery in its reply to the UN. It accused the monks there of long being engaged in acts \"aimed at disturbing social order\", including vandalism and self-immolation. \"Some monks of the monastery also frequented places of entertainment, prostitution, alcohol and gambling, and spread pornographic CD-Roms,\" said the official document from May this year. China told the UN that forcing the monks into re-education was a \"showcase\" of how to manage religious affairs. Many at Kirti monastery appear to disagree with that view."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15169007", "title": "Self-immolation 'trend' at restive Tibetan monastery"}}

UK manufacturing is currently covered by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). But if the country leaves the EU without a deal, then from 30 March next year UK aircraft components would not be covered - either in the EU or in other countries such as the US and China. This would mean that without recognised safety certificates any aircraft using those parts could be grounded. \"That is the extreme case\", said Mr Everitt, \"but it's not scare-mongering [to say that] aircraft will not fly.\" His comments come as carmaker Jaguar Land Rover warned that a \"bad\" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. A spokesman for Theresa May said that the Prime Minister was aware of the views of business, and a forthcoming white paper policy document would give more details on the proposed relationship between the UK and EU. \"The PM has been very clear that we take the views of business seriously and we also know the importance of providing certainty as we leave the EU,\" the spokesman said. He said it was vital that UK regulatory agencies began drawing up contingency plans with EASA. In a letter last month to the European Commission, ADS said that \"EASA and the CAA [the UK's Civil Aviation Authority] need to urgently begin technical and contingency planning.... separate to the political negotiations.\" However, so far the European Commission has refused to allow any technical discussions between UK and EU aviation authorities. Any such talks could take up to nine months to avoid potential pitfalls come March 2019, meaning they need to start almost immediately, \"otherwise they are not going to happen in time,\" said ADS chief economist Jeegar Kakkad. ADS argues that the UK aerospace industry - which generated £35bn in turnover and accounted for £30bn in exports last year - needs regulatory alignment with the EU and continued membership of EASA. The industry body wants the UK to remain part of the EU's customs union in order to maintain frictionless borders. Under the government's current border proposals, the ADS estimates that once the UK leaves the EU costs for the industry could rise by £2.3bn a year. \"From an industrial point of view, we see the potential for serious disruption and costs which will make [all of] Europe less competitive,\" said Mr Everitt. A number of big businesses including Airbus, BMW, Siemens and Jaguar Land Rover, have recently issued similar calls for clarity on Brexit, and warned that without a deal investment in the UK could suffer."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44725606", "title": "No-deal Brexit 'could ground aircraft'"}}

Nearly a third of respondents thought the referendum had not made any difference, and 11% felt it had been positive. More than 100 bosses of FTSE 500 firms responded to the survey. \"Unfortunately, it looks like business in this country is already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU,\" said Ipsos Mori chief executive, Ben Page. \"According to respondents there is no sign that this is likely to ease this year, with two thirds saying they thought their business situation would get worse in the next 12 months,\" he added. Two-thirds of the chairmen, chief executives and other directors who responded thought that their business would be worse off after the UK left the European Union. Meanwhile 45% of the 114 FTSE 500 bosses surveyed expected to feel a negative impact in five years' time. However, 32% said their business would start to feel the positive effects of leaving the EU in five years' time. Most of the business leaders (96%) who responded said they were confident their company could adapt to the consequences of leaving the EU. More than half of them (54%) said the most important thing for the UK to obtain during exit negotiations was the movement or access of skilled labour. In order for businesses to be successful post-Brexit, 86% of executives thought the most important factors were cutting the amount and complexity of regulation, and keeping it easy to recruit staff from the European Union."}], "prompt_templates": ["Summarize the English article below in a paragraph of 1 or 2 sentences.\n\nAnswer only using the following format:\nSummary: $SUMMARY\nReplace $SUMMARY with the summary.{fewshot_examples}\n\nArticle:\n```\n{text}\n```"], "metadata": {"language": "en", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38878091", "title": "Brexit vote already bad for firms, bosses say"}}
{"id": "uk-51470342", "label": "More cases of coronavirus are \"highly likely\" to be seen in the UK and come from overseas, says a senior health official.", "prompts": [{"text": "Prof Paul Cosford, from Public Health England, told the BBC his teams were doing their best to contain the spread. But given there were now a number of \"countries of concern\", new cases were likely to be brought in by people travelling from abroad. A British man linked to 11 cases of coronavirus has now left hospital. Steve Walsh, 53, from Hove, has fully recovered and poses \"no risk to the public\", NHS England said. Twelve patients treated by two Brighton GPs diagnosed with coronavirus have now been contacted by health officials. All 83 people being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral, after being flown back from China, are free of the virus and will be able to leave their accommodation on Thursday morning. A total of 1,750 people have tested negative for the virus in the UK, with eight testing positive. Prof Cosford, emeritus medical director at PHE, said the biggest risk to the UK were the efforts in mainland China, which - if they don't succeed - could mean \"other countries then have widespread outbreaks of infection\". This could increase the risk of more widespread infection in the UK, he said. Identifying people quickly, tracing close contacts at risk of infection and keeping them in isolation was the main aim. And children did not need to be taken out of school and isolated unless \"we tell them that's what is needed\", Prof Cosford said. Steve Walsh was the third case to be confirmed in the UK, following two Chinese nationals testing positive in York. He was infected by the virus after attending a business conference in Singapore in January, and returned via France where he passed it unknowingly on to 11 other people - five of whom then returned to the UK. Mr Walsh, 53, from Hove, who had only mild symptoms, said he was now happy to be home and feeling well. \"I want to give a big thank you to the NHS who have been great throughout, and my thoughts are with everyone around the world who continues to be affected by the virus,\" Mr Walsh said. \"It's good to be back with my family and I would ask you please to respect our privacy from this point on.\" Brighton tracing The two Brighton GPs with coronavirus, who stayed in the same ski chalet in France as Mr Walsh, are now in isolation. The GP practices in Brighton where they worked have now reopened after a deep clean. Worthing Hospital, where one of the GPs worked a shift in A&E, continues to operate as normal, a Department of Health spokeswoman said. Patcham Nursing Home in Brighton, which was also visited by one of the GPs, is now open again to visitors. One of the Brighton doctors has been named as Catriona Greenwood. The second GP has not been named. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said the official name for the disease caused by the coronavirus is Covid-19. Prof Neil Ferguson, infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, told the BBC that he thought new cases of the virus could still rise. \"I think we're in the early phases of a global pandemic at the moment,\" he said. Prof Ferguson added it was likely that only one in three cases coming into the UK was being picked up. But John Oxford, emeritus professor of virology at Queen Mary University London, said he thought the virus had a weakness - and people's actions could help slow transmission. \"It's not about wearing a mask - it's less of the hand-shaking, touching and kissing,\" he said, speaking on the Today programme. What are the symptoms of coronavirus and what can help stop its spread? The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. On Monday, the government issued new powers in England to keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. Under the Department of Health measures, people will not be free to leave quarantine and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. The BBC understands that two prisoners on a wing at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire have been tested for the virus. One of them, a remand prisoner, had recently returned to the UK from Thailand. The overall number of infections is more than 44,000 on mainland China, with cases in more than 20 countries. On Wednesday, around 300 employees were evacuated from Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, after one person fell ill with the virus. The Chinese Grand Prix - which had been scheduled for 19 April in Shanghai - has been postponed as a result of the outbreak. Have you been affected by any of the issues raised here?
